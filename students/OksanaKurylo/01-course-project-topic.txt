Topic: "Identifying Subjective Statements in News"

Reason:

I’m interested in studying how factive and non-factive verbs of opinion attribution can bias people’s perceptions of reported opinions and beliefs. 

Problems to solve:
Collect verbs:
- Verbs of opinion attribution - verbs that are used to embed the opinion as its complement clause. 
- Factive verbs is related to presupposition, namely that they presuppose the truth of the complement. 

Data:

Data taken from the media coverage of one particular topic, which is a coronavirus. This is a domain that’s rich in reported opinions: journalists are quoting from entities like scientists, organizations and the like to sample from the range of differing opinions that compose a given debate.
