A basketball star at Power Memorial Academy in the late 1930s, Ezersky was accused of accepting money in his senior year and was subsequently ruled ineligible for college basketball. Though Ezersky is listed as having played for the University of Rhode Island team, he never played basketball at a college level.Ezersky attempted a career in baseball following his college basketball ruling and tried out for the Detroit Tigers alongside close friend Buddy Kerr in 1941, but he was sent to the minor leagues and failed to make it out of spring training.  He returned to New York, where he became a cab driver and was later drafted into the military for World War II. He was discharged from service in 1946, and resumed his cab driving before attempting to pursue a career in professional basketball.  He signed with the Brooklyn Gothams of the American Basketball League, but only managed to play two games for the team. The following season, he signed with the Tri-Cities Blackhawks of the National Basketball League, and played with the team for two months. Ezersky spent the next two seasons in the Basketball Association of America and, later, the National Basketball Association, playing with the Baltimore Bullets in two stints and the Boston Celtics in one, with the latter team having previously drafted him in the 1947 BAA draft. He was not resigned by either team following the 1949–50 NBA season, so he spent his final two seasons playing basketball in the ABL for a second time with the Hartford Hurricanes and Wilkes-Barre Barons, and in the Eastern Professional Basketball League with the Scranton Miners.
After retiring from playing professional basketball in 1952, Ezersky returned to his career as a cab driver in New York City. He moved to East Bay, California in 1981, where he resumed his cab driving career until he retired in 2000, aged seventy-eight. Ezersky was a member of the group of NBA veterans that lobbied against the NBA's pension rules, which previously required pre-1965 players to have played in the NBA or BAA for five years to be eligible. The requirement was changed to three years and made Ezersky, who spent three years in the two leagues, able to receive the pension.

Jon Barry ESPN BioJohn E. Foley (born April 19, 1939) is a retired American professional basketball player formerly of the Boston Celtics and New York Knicks in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected in the second round as the 18th pick in the 1962 NBA Draft by the Celtics and spent one season playing in the league. Foley was given the nickname "The Shot" because of his explosive offensive ability.A native of Worcester, Massachusetts, Foley attended Assumption High School, where he graduated in 1958. He decided to stay close to home when playing college basketball and enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross. Since college freshmen were ineligible to participate on varsity teams, Foley's college career did not officially begin until 1959–60. In his three seasons as a Crusader, he scored so many points that his nickname, "The Shot", was what he was commonly referred to. In his sophomore season, Foley averaged 24.6 points per game (ppg), followed by 26.9 ppg and 33.3 ppg during his junior and senior seasons, respectively. In his senior year of 1961–62, he finished second in the nation in scoring behind Utah's Bill McGill (38.8 ppg). That season, Foley garnered consensus Second Team All-American honors. In addition to his high season scoring averages, Foley also put up big single game numbers. He is the record holder of the two highest scoring games in school history—56 points against Connecticut in 1962 and 55 against Colgate in 1960—as well as having scored 40 or more points five times in his career. Foley became the first player in school history to score 2,000 career points, and his 2,185 points was the most in school history until the early 1980s.
Foley's professional career was not spectacular, especially compared to his college career. He played in five total games for the Celtics in 1962–63, averaging 6.4 points, before being sold to the New York Knicks on January 22, 1963. He then played in six games for the Knicks and averaged 3.5 points. For his career, Foley scored 53 points, grabbed 16 rebounds and recorded 5 assists.


== References ==Bradley Allen Lohaus (born September 29, 1964) is an American retired professional basketball player who was selected by the Boston Celtics in the second round (45th pick overall) of the 1987 NBA Draft. A 6'11" center-power forward from the University of Iowa, Lohaus played in eleven NBA seasons for eight different teams: the Celtics, Sacramento Kings, Minnesota Timberwolves, Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, San Antonio Spurs, New York Knicks and Toronto Raptors. He was featured in the 1993 arcade edition of the popular video game NBA Jam.


== High school and college ==
Lohaus was a McDonald's All-American in 1982 at Greenway High School in Phoenix, Arizona under varsity coach Pete Babcock, who went on to work for six different NBA franchises in various capacities, including general manager.
Lohaus played at Iowa from 1982 to 1987 under three different head coaches. He was recruited and played his freshman season under head coach Lute Olson. After Olson left for The University of Arizona, Lohaus reluctantly stayed at Iowa and played his sophomore and junior seasons under George Raveling (redshirting a year between seasons). He then flourished during his senior season under new coach Dr. Tom Davis as a shooting big man who defended the front of the Hawkeyes' fullcourt pressing defense. That year, the team reached the NCAA Elite Eight, ending with a school record 30 wins, with Lohaus averaging 11.3 points and leading the team in rebounds and blocked shots.


== Professional career ==
Lohaus was drafted by the Boston Celtics late in the second round; in 1987–88 the team went 57-25 in the regular season, and bowed out to the Detroit Pistons in the hard-fought six-game Eastern Conference Finals. He was traded along with Danny Ainge to the Sacramento Kings for Joe Kleine and Ed Pinckney on February 23, 1989.
Lohaus was acquired by the Minnesota Timberwolves in the 1989 NBA Expansion Draft, then traded on January 4, 1990 to the Milwaukee Bucks for center Randy Breuer, giving Lohaus the opportunity to further display his perimeter game and long-range shooting ability. He also completed his bachelor's degree at The University of Iowa the ensuing summer semester.
After that season, Lohaus played an additional four full seasons for the Bucks, scoring 314 three-point field goals (whereas he was 5 for 40 in his first 2½ seasons). The Bucks advanced to the playoffs twice in that timeframe.
He then played for the Miami Heat in 1994–95 with former Iowa teammate Kevin Gamble, where Lohaus averaged 4.4 points per game. He spent his final three seasons with the Spurs, Knicks (via trade, with the Knicks getting Lohaus, J. R. Reid and a first-round pick in 1996, while the Spurs received Charles Smith and Monty Williams), Toronto (November–December 1996), a stint with the Italian team Scavolini Pesaro (October–December 1997), then back again with the Spurs in 1997–98, later in the season and into the playoffs. During the lengthy NBA lockout in 1998–99, Lohaus contemplated retiring and ultimately did not play professionally again.
In his NBA career, Lohaus played in 656 games over 11 years, scoring a total of 3,854 points, and converting 392 three-point shots (over 30% of his total points scored).
Lohaus appears in the video game NBA Jam as a member of the Milwaukee Bucks, as B.Lohaus.


== Personal life ==
He has had a home in the Iowa City area since 1987, and is a scout with the Spurs organization, covering the midwest region, and also is a broker for commercial airplanes and airplane parts. He endowed a full athletic scholarship to the Iowa Hawkeyes basketball program in 1996, the first former student-athlete to do so in the school's history. He and his wife Anne have two sons, Wyatt and Tanner, who both formerly played basketball for the Northern Iowa Panthers.

He is married to Nikki Bonacorsi and is the father of one daughter--Amelia. Then known as Jason Williams, he won the 2001 NCAA Championship with Duke, and was named NABC Player of the Year in 2001 and 2002. He was drafted second overall in the 2002 NBA Draft by the Bulls. He asked to be called Jay on joining the Bulls, to avoid confusion with two other players in the NBA at the time. His playing career was effectively ended by a motorcycle accident in 2003. He last signed with the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League, but was waived on December 30, 2006 due to lingering physical effects from his accident.Since retiring, he has worked as an analyst for ESPN, intitally working on
college basketball. In 2019, however, Williams was re-assigned to the NBA full-time with his addition on ESPN's NBA Countdown program.


== High school ==
Williams grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, and attended St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, graduating in 1999. He not only excelled at basketball, but took an active interest in other activities, most notably chess. His nickname in high school was "Jay Dubs." Williams also played junior varsity soccer during his freshman year and was the state volleyball player of the year during his senior year. In basketball that year, Williams was named a First Team All-State Player in New Jersey, the New Jersey Player of the Year, a Parade All-American, a USA Today first team All-American, and a McDonald's All-American, where he competed in the Slam Dunk Contest and the McDonald's All-American Game, scoring 20 points in the contest.

He was also named the recipient of the 1999 Morgan Wootten Award for his basketball achievements and his work in the classroom, where he maintained a 3.6 GPA.


== College career ==
At Duke, Williams, a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m), 195-pound (88 kg) point guard, became one of the few freshmen in school history to average double figures in scoring and was named ACC Rookie of the Year and National Freshman of the Year by The Sporting News, averaging 14.5 points, 6.5 assists and 4.2 rebounds per contest. He was also a first team Freshman All-American by Basketball Times.The next season Williams started all 39 games and led the Devils to the 2001 NCAA National Championship, earning NABC Player of the Year honors. His 841 points broke Dick Groat's 49-year Duke record for points in a season, while he led all tournament scorers with a 25.7 ppg average. Williams also set the NCAA Tournament record for three-pointers attempted (66), while also making 132 three-point field goals—good for the sixth-highest total in NCAA history.  His 21.6 ppg led the ACC and made him the first Duke player since Danny Ferry (1989) to lead the league in scoring. His 6.1 assists were good for second in the league, while he also ranked second in three-point field goal percentage (.427) and first in three-pointers made (3.4 per game).  Williams was widely considered the best player in college basketball, earning both the prestigious Naismith Award and Wooden Award as College Basketball's Player of the Year in 2002. He graduated with a degree in Sociology in 2002, and left Duke with 2,079 points, good for sixth all-time, and with his jersey number 22 retired at Senior Day.
He had 36 double-figure scoring games in a single season (tied for 5th-most in Duke history as of March 28, 2010, with Jon Scheyer, Shane Battier, and J.J. Redick).In 2001–02, Williams, Carlos Boozer, and Mike Dunleavy Jr. each scored at least 600 points for the season, a feat only matched at Duke by Jon Scheyer, Kyle Singler, and Nolan Smith in the 2009–10 season.  Williams (841) and Shane Battier (778) on the 2001 national championship team were one of only two Duke duos to each score over 700 points in a season, the other duo being Scheyer (728) and Singler (707) in the 2009–10 season.


=== College statistics ===


== NBA career ==
Williams was selected by the Chicago Bulls with the second overall pick in the 2002 NBA draft, after Yao Ming was selected by the Houston Rockets.
He played for the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship.Williams was a starter in the Bulls' line-up for most of the 2002–03 NBA season. Although his performance was inconsistent and he competed for playing time with Jamal Crawford, he showed signs of promise including posting a triple-double in a win over his homestate team, the New Jersey Nets.


=== Motorcycle accident ===
On the night of June 19, 2003, Williams crashed his Yamaha YZF-R6 motorcycle into a streetlight at the intersection of Belmont and Honore streets in Chicago's Roscoe Village neighborhood. Williams was not wearing a helmet, was not licensed to ride a motorcycle in Illinois, and was also violating the terms of his Bulls contract by riding a motorcycle. Williams' injuries included a severed main nerve in his leg, fractured pelvis and three dislocated ligaments in his left knee including the ACL. He required physical therapy to regain the use of his leg. A week after the motorcycle crash the Bulls drafted point guard Kirk Hinrich. When it became clear Williams would not be returning to the Bulls for a long time, if at all, because of his injuries, he was waived. Legally, the Bulls did not have to pay him any salary, because his injuries occurred while he was violating his contract by riding a motorcycle. Instead, the Bulls gave Williams $3 million when they waived him, which Williams could use toward future rehabilitation expenses. Williams stated at the time that he would continue to train and intended to make a return to the Bulls, but in his 2016 memoir, he mentioned that a lot of the Bulls' severance package fueled his addiction to illegal painkillers. In the interim, he appeared in college and high school basketball broadcasts on ESPN as a commentator.

However, on October 22, the Nets released Williams.He then signed with the Austin Toros of the NBA Development League, but on December 30, 2006, the Toros waived him due to injury. Williams subsequently announced that he had no plans to resume his basketball career.

Sullinger Proving To Be Steal of NBA DraftEric C. Williams (born July 17, 1972) is an American former professional basketball player who, until 2007, had played in the National Basketball Association.


== Career ==
Following a collegiate career which began at Burlington County College in New Jersey, then Vincennes University in Indiana, followed by Providence College in Rhode Island, the 6' 8" small forward was selected by the Boston Celtics with the 14th pick in the 1995 NBA Draft. He played two years with them before being traded to the Denver Nuggets during the 1997 offseason for a couple of second round draft picks. The Nuggets only got four games out of Williams during the 1997-98 campaign due to him tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. The following season, he returned, but only played in 38 of 82 regular season games with Denver before they repatriated him back to Boston along with Danny Fortson and Eric Washington plus a future draft pick in exchange for Ron Mercer, Ronald "Popeye" Jones, and Dwayne Schintzius. His second tenure with the Celtics lasted over four seasons until they traded him to the Cleveland Cavaliers along with Tony Battie and Kedrick Brown in a swap for Ricky Davis, Chris Mihm, Michael Stewart, and a second round draft pick on December 15, 2003. He became a free agent after 50 games with the Cavaliers, and signed with the New Jersey Nets prior to the 2004-05 season. Williams was soon part of a blockbuster player trade when the Nets sent him, Aaron Williams, Alonzo Mourning and two future first-round draft picks to the Toronto Raptors for franchise player Vince Carter.
In 2005, Williams decided to launch his own line of clothing honoring the fictional Negro Basketball League.On June 21, 2006, Williams was traded with Matt Bonner and a second round pick in the 2009 NBA Draft to San Antonio for Rasho Nesterovič and cash.On February 13, 2007 he was traded along with the 2nd round pick in the 2009 NBA Draft that the Spurs got from the Raptors to the Charlotte Bobcats for Melvin Ely.

Chuck Cooper at Find a Grave
Phil Axelrod, "Duquesne honors legacy of Chuck Cooper", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 6, 2009.Kelly Tyler Olynyk ( oh-LIN-ik; born April 19, 1991) is a Canadian professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Gonzaga Bulldogs, where he earned NCAA All-American honours in 2013. After forgoing his senior year, Olynyk was selected with the 13th overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks in the 2013 NBA draft, before being immediately traded to the Boston Celtics. He also represents the Canadian national team.


== Early life ==
Olynyk was born in Toronto, where he started playing basketball at an early age. He and fellow future NBA player Cory Joseph were both on a Scarborough Blues club team that rarely lost in the late 1990s and early 2000s. One defeat came against rival Toronto 5–0, led by Stephen Curry. Olynyk moved to Kamloops, British Columbia when he was in grade 7.


== High school career ==
Olynyk did not attend a high school or prep school in the United States; he instead stayed home at South Kamloops Secondary School, exposing himself to U.S. competition and coaches while playing on provincial teams – competing at Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and non-AAU tournaments in the States – and the Canadian junior national team. Olynyk developed as a point guard, continuing to play the position even after growing from 6'3" (1.90 m) to 6'10" (2.08 m) in grade 11. Olynyk was heavily recruited out of high school by the likes of Syracuse, Providence and North Carolina State. He chose Gonzaga in part so he could play closer to home.Olynyk was named the Basketball BC outstanding high school player of the year in his grade 12 year, leading his South Kamloops Titans to a 36–2 record and a third-place finish at the BC AAA High School Boys' Basketball Championships.Olynyk was also a quarterback for the Titans when he was in high school and broke his arm during a playoff game in 2007.


== College career ==
Olynyk played college basketball at Gonzaga from 2009 to 2013. He was mostly a bench player for the Bulldogs in his freshman and sophomore years, averaging around 12 to 13 minutes per game. In order to improve his game and get stronger, Gonzaga and Olynyk agreed that he would redshirt his junior year (2011–12), meaning he would practice with the team, but not play.
Olynyk returned to the Bulldogs lineup for the first game of the 2012–13 season, and had a great season, being selected as a Consensus First-Team All-American, as well as to the 2012–13 Academic All-America first team. Following his redshirt junior year, he opted for the NBA draft, thereby forgoing his senior year of eligibility (though by that time he had already received his bachelor's degree in accounting).


== Professional career ==

He made his season debut for the Celtics on November 9, 2016, playing 25 minutes and scoring two points in a 118–93 loss to the Washington Wizards.

In his debut for the Heat in their season opener on October 18, 2017, Olynyk scored 10 points in a 116–109 loss to the Orlando Magic.

NBA coach bioThe 2009–10 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team represented the Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team in the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. Their head coach was Brad Stevens, serving his 3rd year. The Bulldogs played their home games at the Hinkle Fieldhouse, which has a capacity of approximately 10,000.The Bulldogs won the 2010 Horizon League Men's Basketball Tournament to receive the Horizon's automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, earning a 5 seed in the West Region. They defeated 12 seed UTEP and 13 seed Murray State to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The team next defeated 1 seed Syracuse to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history, and then defeated 2 seed Kansas State to earn their first Final Four appearance in school history.  They were only the second team from a mid-major conference to "officially" advance that far in the tournament since UNLV made the Final Four in 1991.
On April 3, 2010, Butler defeated Michigan State and advanced to the National Championship game against Duke.  On April 5, just a few miles away from the Bulldogs' home court, Duke defeated Butler in a back and forth game that ratings showed was the highest-rated Championship game of the decade."

A few commentators picked the Bulldogs as a possible "sleeper team" to make the Final Four.  Stevens wasn't so sure, privately telling his father, "We have a really good team, and I’m not sure how far we can go this year, but next year, we ought to go really far."

Howard hit 1 of 2 free throws, giving Murray State a chance to tie or win the game on its final possession.  With less than five seconds on the clock, Hayward deflected a Murray State pass into the back court.  By the time the ball was recovered, the game was over and Stevens was heading to his first Sweet Sixteen.3/25 – Butler vs. #4 (1 seed) Syracuse (NCAA Tournament – Sweet Sixteen)
Butler Headed To Elite Eight
Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse.  Unlike their first two games, the Bulldogs got off to a good start, jumping out to a 12–1 lead and taking a 35–25 lead to the break.  Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer.  Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession.  The game remained tight for the next several minutes.  At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead.  Stevens again called time out and Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes.  Butler took a 60–54 lead on a Willie Veasley tip in at the 0:59 mark and held on to win 63–59.  The win allowed Butler to advance to the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.3/27 – Butler vs. #7 (2 seed) Kansas St. (NCAA Tournament – Elite Eight)
BU's NEXT STOP: Final Four In Indy!
The Bulldogs met 2nd-seeded Kansas State in the regional finals.  Perhaps feeling the effects of their double overtime 101–96 win two days prior, Kansas State got off to a slow start, scoring just 20 points in the first half to trail 27–20.  Butler kept the lead in the upper single digits for most of the second half and led 49–39 with 7:38 to go.  Kansas State then went on a 13–2 and took a 52–51 lead on a Denis Clemente 3-pointer with 4:50 to go.  Brad Stevens immediately called time out and re-focused the team.  "Play your game. Just play your game" he told the team. On the ensuing possession, Hayward pulled down an offensive rebounded on a Mack miss and was fouled.  He hit both free throws and Butler didn't trail again, out-scoring Kansas State 12–2 before the Wildcats hit a meaningless shot at the buzzer to make the final margin 63–56.  When asked how Butler won the game, Howard said "It’s all five guys out there defending, helping each other".In the post game celebration, Stevens and walk-on forward Emerson Kampen connected on a flying back-bump that soon became one of the iconic images of the tournament.  Stevens adopted the move after he saw it bringing together teammates during pregame rituals.  Stevens and Kampden did a back-bump in the locker room after the Murray State and Syracuse games, revealing it to the public after beating Kansas State.The win earned the Bulldogs a trip back to Indianapolis for the first Final Four appearance in school and Horizon League history.  The win made Stevens, at age 33, the youngest coach to lead a team to the Final Four since Bob Knight made his first Final Four appearance at age 32 in 1973.  Butler became the smallest school (enrollment 4,200) to make the Final Four since seeding began in 1979.4/3 – Butler vs. #13/#12 (5 seed) Michigan St. (NCAA Tournament – Final Four)
Bulldogs Advance To National Title Game
Brad Stevens and the Butler Bulldogs faced off with Michigan State in the national semi-finals.  Korie Lucious opened the game by hitting two straight three-pointers, but Gordon Hayward responded with two three-pointers of his own to tie the score at 6.  Butler took a 7–6 lead on a Shelvin Mack free throw before Michigan State went on an 8–0 run.  Matt Howard got in early foul trouble and sat most of the first half.  Butler fought back though, tying the game at 28 on a Mack three-pointer with 35 seconds left in the first half.Lucious hit another three to open the second half, giving Michigan State a 31–28 lead.  The teams traded the lead a few times before Mack hit a layup to put Butler up 34–33 with 17:43 to go.  Butler then held Michigan State scoreless for the next 3:30, pushing the lead to 38–33.  After two free throws by Howard made the Butler lead 46–41 with 9:24 to go, both teams locked down on defense.  The score was 47–44 with 2:45 to go in the game when Michigan State called a time out to set up a play.  Stevens correctly anticipated the play call and had Ronald Nored, the team's best defender, switch onto Lucious off a screen.  Nored stole the ball and Shawn Vanzant got fouled on the resulting run out, hitting 1 of 2.  After a Draymond Green jump shot cut the lead to 48–46, Hayward got a layup off an offensive rebound by Willie Veasley.  Durrell Summers then got fouled with 1:18 remaining.  He hit the first free throw, but missed the second.  However, Michigan State got an offensive rebound and Green was fouled.  He made both foul shots to bring Michigan State within a point with 56 seconds to go. Butler came up empty on its possession, giving Michigan State a chance to take the lead.  Green missed a layup with 8 seconds on the clock and Nored came down with the rebound.  He was quickly fouled.  Nored, who had shot only 61% on the year and 3 of 12 during the tournament on free throws, hit both shots to give Butler a 52–49 lead.  After a Michigan State time out, Butler intentionally fouled Lucious with 2 seconds remaining to prevent a potentially game tying 3-pointer.  After making the first, Lucious intentionally missed the second free throw.  Hayward came down with the rebound, his ninth of the game, to seal the victory.Butler won the game despite shooting just 30.6% for the game and going without Howard and Mack for a large portion of the second half.  Howard hit his head and left the game dazed, while Mack was experiencing leg cramps.  Michigan State coach Tom Izzo called it "one of the more physical games we've been involved in."  He added "I like the way they play, I like their story. They play like a Big Ten team."  Of 595 games played on neutral courts during the 2009–10 season, Butler's 30.6% was the third-lowest shooting percentage by a winning team.  Butler became the first team since the shot clock was adopted for the 1985–86 season to hold five straight tournament opponents under 60 points.4/5 – Butler vs. #3 (1 seed) Duke (NCAA Tournament – Championship Game)

On April 5, 2010, Butler became the smallest school to play for a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970, facing Duke, who was seeking its fourth national championship. The New York Times called the game "the most eagerly awaited championship game in years".Duke jumped out to a 6–1 lead to start the game, but Butler rallied back, taking a 12–11 lead at the 12:28 mark of the first half. At the under eight-minute TV timeout, Butler held a 20–18 lead.  After the timeout, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Coach Stevens then called a timeout.  With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, backup center Avery Jukes hit two three-pointers and a made tip-in en route to 10 first half points, tying his single-game season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32.The second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a lead larger than two points until a Brian Zoubek layup put Duke up 47–43 with 12:27 remaining.  Butler stayed within 5 points the rest of the way. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith.  Butler missed its next shot, but forced a missed shot and turned Duke over after an offensive rebound.  Matt Howard made a layup for Butler to make it a 60–57 game with 1:44 remaining. Smith missed a layup for Duke and Howard made another layup after collecting an offensive rebound on a missed three-pointer by Shelvin Mack.  Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski then called a time out.  Kyle Singler missed a jump shot from the right corner with 36 seconds remaining, giving Butler a chance to take the lead.  Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play.  They were then forced to call their last timeout when they were unable to get the ball in-bounds.  Next, Gordon Hayward missed a short fade-away jumper while being defended by center Brian Zoubek.  Zoubek came down strong with the rebound, forcing Butler to foul with less than 3.6 seconds remaining.  Zoubek made the first foul shot and then intentionally missed the second, likely knowing Butler had no timeouts remaining.  Hayward threw a desperation shot from half court.  The ball bounced off the backboard and then the rim.  According to an analysis by ESPN, Hayward's aim was off by three inches (7.6 cm), or less than one degree, on the x-axis.The loss ended the winningest season in school history.  It also snapped Butler's 25-game winning streak, which was also a school record.  The following day President Barack Obama called and congratulated the team, despite the loss.  "I just didn't want to call the winner because you guys grabbed the nation's attention. We appreciate the way you guys play." he told the team.

He played college basketball for the University of Florida, and was the starting center on the Gators teams that won back-to-back NCAA national championships in 2006 and 2007. He was drafted with the third overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks, a team he played nine seasons with before joining the Celtics in 2016. He is a five-time NBA All-Star. He also represents the Dominican Republic national team.


== Early years and high school career ==
Horford was born in Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. His father, Tito Horford, played three years in the NBA and several more overseas. In the summer of 2000, Horford and his family moved to Lansing, Michigan, where he attended Grand Ledge High School in Grand Ledge, Michigan, and was a star on its basketball team. Horford holds seven school records, including most career points (1,239). As a senior, he was named Class A Player of the Year after averaging 21 points, 13 rebounds and five blocks per game. While at Grand Ledge, Horford played AAU basketball for the Michigan Mustangs, who were runners-up in the Adidas Big Time National Tournament. Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Horford was listed as the No. 7 power forward and the No. 36 player in the nation in 2004.


== College career ==
Horford accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Florida, where he played for coach Billy Donovan and teamed up alongside Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer and Taurean Green. He made an immediate impact as a Gator in 2004–05, starting at center in the front court with David Lee, and helped the Gators win the 2005 Southeastern Conference Tournament championship.
The Gators surged through the 2005–06 season, winning the SEC championship for a second straight year. They entered the 2006 NCAA Tournament as the No. 3 seed. The Gators swept through the first four rounds to reach the Final Four. There they defeated George Mason to reach the final.

Al Horford on Twitter 
Al Horford on FacebookLouis Charles Tsioropoulos (Greek: Λουδοβίκος Τσιωρόπουλος; 31 August 1930 – 22 August 2015) was an American professional basketball player who played for the NBA's Boston Celtics for three seasons from 1956–1959. He was born in Lynn, Massachusetts.


== College career ==

Tsioropoulos played college basketball at the University of Kentucky under legendary coach Adolph Rupp. As a sophomore in 1951, he was a member of Kentucky's NCAA Championship team, which defeated Kansas State 68-58 in the Championship game.In the fall of 1952, a point shaving scandal involving three Kentucky players (a fourth player, Bill Spivey, a teammate of Tsioropoulos on the 1951 National Championship team, was alleged to have been involved in the scandal but denied the charge) over a four-year period forced Kentucky to forfeit its upcoming season, which would have been the senior year for Tsiroropoulos and future Hall-of-Famers Frank Ramsey and Cliff Hagan. The suspension of the season made Kentucky's basketball team, in effect, the first college sports team to get the "death penalty", which actually was nothing more than the NCAA asking members schools not to schedule Kentucky, and not mandating it.
Tsioropoulos, Ramsey and Hagan all graduated from Kentucky in 1953, and as a result, became eligible for the NBA draft. All three players were selected by the Boston Celtics: Ramsey in the first round, Hagan in the third, and Tsioropoulos in the seventh. All three also returned to Kentucky for one more season, despite graduating. After finishing the regular season (one in which Tsioropoulos averaged 14.5 points per game) with a perfect 25-0 record and a #1 ranking in the Associated Press, Kentucky had been offered a bid into the NCAA Tournament. However, then-existing NCAA rules prohibited graduate students from participating in post-season play. The Wildcats declined the bid because their participation would have forced them to play without Tsioropoulos, Ramsey and Hagan, thus jeopardizing their perfect season.
Tsioropoulos' #16 jersey was retired by his alma mater, and he is in the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame.


== Professional career ==
Tsioropoulos spent some time in the Air Force before joining the Celtics in 1956.As Tom Heinsohn's backup at small forward, Tsioropoulos played three seasons with the Celtics, winning NBA championships in 1957 and 1959. In 157 NBA games, he averaged 5.8 points per game. His best NBA season was 1957–58; in which he averaged 7.7 points per game. This season was the only one of his three NBA seasons in which he played in the playoffs; he averaged 6.3 points per game. That year, the Bob Pettit-led St. Louis Hawks (which also featured Tsioropoulos' ex-college teammate Hagan, who had been traded to the Hawks in the Bill Russell deal) defeated the Celtics in the NBA Finals.


== Post basketball career ==
Tsioropoulos was a principal of Jefferson County High School, and later lived in Florida. He died in Louisville on 22 August 2015 at the age of 84.

Lou Tsioropoulos profile @ celtic-nation.comRonald Eugene Mercer (born May 18, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. After his career at the University of Kentucky, Mercer played for several teams in the National Basketball Association; he ended his career with the New Jersey Nets in 2005.


== Basketball career ==


=== Early years ===
Ron Mercer was twice named "Mr. Basketball" of Tennessee while at Goodpasture Christian School in Madison, Tennessee. He then transferred to Oak Hill Academy in Mouth of Wilson, Virginia, and was rated by Bob Gibbons to be the best prep player of the class of 1995.


=== University of Kentucky ===
Mercer had a very successful collegiate career, having been an All-American and all-Southeastern Conference player at Kentucky, and part of a national championship team his freshman year.


=== NBA ===


==== Boston Celtics ====
He was selected with the sixth overall pick of the 1997 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics and was reunited with fellow Kentucky teammate Antoine Walker, and Rick Pitino, his coach at Kentucky who had just become the coach of the Celtics. Prior to Mercer's drafting, Pitino was recorded as saying that he did not envisage Mercer as having the necessary talent to be selected very high. Some felt this was just a ploy to scare the other teams away from him so as to increase the likelihood of Mercer being available by the time the Celtics got an opportunity to make their draft selection. It turned out it was.


==== Denver Nuggets ====
After two seasons in Boston, Mercer was traded by the Celtics along with Popeye Jones and Dwayne Schintzius to the Denver Nuggets for Danny Fortson, Eric Williams, Eric Washington and a future draft choice.  He played 37 games for Denver in 1999–2000, then played the final 31 games that season with the Orlando Magic due to a trade.


==== Chicago Bulls ====
He left after that season, the next year signing as a free agent with the Chicago Bulls. He averaged 19.7 points per game in his first year with them.


==== Indiana Pacers ====
Despite Mercer's 16.8 points per game in 2001–02, he was traded midway through the season with Brad Miller, Ron Artest (now known as Metta World Peace) and Kevin Ollie to the Indiana Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson and a second-round draft pick. In Indiana he served merely as a reserve player, and his play declined rapidly over his one-and-a-half-season stint with the club.


==== San Antonio Spurs ====
Before the 2003–04 season, he was traded to the San Antonio Spurs in a three-team trade that again involved Brad Miller and the Sacramento Kings' Hedo Türkoğlu. After playing 39 games with the Spurs, he was released.


==== New Jersey Nets ====
Prior to the 2004–05 season, he signed with his seventh NBA team, the New Jersey Nets.On August 15, 2005, prior to the 2005–06 NBA season, Mercer was waived by the Nets to avoid the league's luxury tax as part of the new labor agreement. He has not played in the league since.

SMU Mustangs bioMaurice E. "Maury" King (December 1, 1934 – September 17, 2007) was an American professional basketball player, who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Boston Celtics and Chicago Zephyrs, and with the Baltimore Bullets of the Eastern Professional Basketball League (EPBL) and the Kansas City Steers of the American Basketball League (ABL).
King played collegiately for the Kansas Jayhawks and was the first black starter in Kansas basketball history in 1954. A teammate of Wilt Chamberlain, he scored 11 points in the famous 1957 NCAA Championship game, where the Jayhawks lost to the North Carolina Tar Heels in triple-overtime. The 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), 195 lb (88 kg; 13.9 st) guard was selected out of the University of Kansas by the Boston Celtics with the 48th overall pick in the 6th round of the 1957 NBA draft.In 1957, King was drafted into the army. When he finished serving his two-year commitment, he joined the Celtics. He played only one game with the Celtics in 1959 (scoring ten points), before he joined the Baltimore Bullets in the Eastern Professional Basketball League. He then joined the Kansas City Steers of the ABL. In the league's fledgling season, King averaged 7.8 points per game, and led the team with an average of 3.2 assists. In Kansas City's second season, King averaged 14.7 points and 5.7 assists before the league folded in mid-season in the winter of 1963. King immediately signed with the Chicago Zephyrs of the NBA, and played in 37 games, averaging 5.8 points and 3.8 assists. Maurice King also was a member of Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity, Mu chapter, at Kansas University, where he and Wilt Chamberlain were teammates and fraternity brothers.
King has four children Yasmin Brown, Calvin Wainright, Maurice King III, Kimberly King-Crawford. King's grandsons Ishmail Wainright played basketball and football for Baylor University and Amaad Wainright is currently playing basketball for Kansas State University.

Maury King at Basketball-Reference.comNed Dixon "Dickie" Hemric (August 29, 1933 – August 3, 2017) was an American collegiate and professional basketball player for Wake Forest University (1952–1955) and the NBA's Boston Celtics (1955–1957).
Hemric played the first two college years at Wake Forest when the school was a member of the Southern Conference. The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) Male Athlete of the Year was created at the start of the 1954 season, and he played his last two seasons in the ACC, setting conference records for scoring and rebounding that were untouched for the first 50 years of the conference's existence. He was honored as the second recipient of the ACC Athlete of the Year in 1955.  In 2002 Hemric was selected to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team, honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history.
Hemric's ACC scoring record of 2,587 points was untouched from 1956 until it was finally broken in 2006 by Duke University's J. J. Redick and in 2009 by Tyler Hansbrough of the University of North Carolina. Hemric held the NCAA record for free throws made in a career with 905 for 54 years until it was passed by Hansbrough. Hemric still holds the Division I record for most free throw attempts (1,359) in a career.Hemric's ACC record of 1,802 career rebounds may never face a serious challenge - for four decades the nearest runner-up was his contemporary Ronnie Shavlik who is now third on the list with 1,567 rebounds from 1954 to 1956. Second is legendary NBA power forward Tim Duncan, who pulled down 1,570 rebounds at Wake Forest from 1994 to 1997. With most of today's elite ACC players leaving for the NBA before completing four seasons, it is difficult to project a scenario in which Hemric's record could ever be broken. Nationally Hemric is still fifth all-time in Division I career rebounds.
Hemric died on August 3, 2017 at his home in North Canton, Ohio nearly four weeks shy of his 84th birthday.

He moved to Cibona Zagreb for the rest of the season. In that year, he averaged 7.4 points, 0.3 assists, 0.3 steals, and 0.9 blocks, in 15.5 minutes per game, in 25 games played in the Adriatic League. His breakout season was in the 2015–16 season.
He was named the 2015–16 ABA League season's Top Prospect. In that season, he averaged 12.7 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 1.2 blocks in 24.8 minutes per game, in 26 games played in the Adriatic League.

As a 16-year-old high school sophomore, the LeFrak City, Queens native who attended academic and athletic powerhouse Archbishop Molloy High School in Briarwood, Queens, was considered one of the best basketball prospects in America.

http://www.thedraftreview.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2026&Itemid=5Gerald Green (born January 26, 1986) is an American professional basketball player. He was drafted by the Boston Celtics with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft. Known for his dunking skill, he has performed well in many slam dunk competitions, having won the 2005 McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest and the 2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, while finishing as the runner-up in the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest.


== Early life ==
Green was born in Houston, Texas. When he was in the 6th grade, he was involved in an accident that left a significant portion of his right ring finger cut off. He was wearing a ring on his right ring finger when he attempted a dunk on a makeshift basketball hoop. The ring caught onto a nail on the goal and his finger was ripped, with amputation being the only option.


== High school career ==
Green did not play high school basketball until his sophomore year, when he played junior varsity for J. Frank Dobie High School. In his junior year, he made the varsity team, but his play was cut short because of academic issues.Green transferred to a charter school, Gulf Shores Academy in Houston where he repeated his junior year. In his senior year at Gulf Shores, he averaged 33 points, 12 rebounds, 7 assists, and 3 blocked shots per game. He was named an All-American and was the high scorer with 24 points in the 2005 McDonald's All-American Game, which features two teams composed of the best high school basketball players in the United States. Green also won the McDonald's All-American Slam Dunk Contest that year, defeating future Duke player Josh McRoberts.
Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Green was listed as the No. 1 player in the nation in 2005.Green originally committed to Oklahoma State University, but later decided to enter the NBA draft upon graduation. He hired an agent, thereby making himself ineligible to participate in NCAA athletics.


== Professional career ==


=== Draft ===
Green was expected by many analysts to be one of the top players chosen but he fell to the Celtics, who selected him with the 18th pick in the NBA draft. His fall is attributed to his decision to give individual workouts only for the teams with the top six picks prior to the draft.Green drew comparisons to former Houston Rockets teammate and star Tracy McGrady in the period leading up to the 2005 NBA draft.Green was one of the last players to enter the NBA directly from high school, as the collective bargaining agreement between NBA owners and the National Basketball Players Association now mandates that American players who enter the draft must be at least one year removed from the graduation of their high school class and reach age 19 no later than December 31 of the calendar year of the draft.


=== Boston Celtics (2005–2007) ===


==== 2005–06 season ====
During the pre-season, Green averaged 8 points and 1.3 rebounds per game for the Celtics in the 2005 Las Vegas Summer League.After seeing limited playing time during the first part of the season, Green was placed on the Fayetteville Patriots of the NBA D-League by the Celtics in January 2006. He was recalled and activated to an NBA roster position on February 3. He was reassigned to the NBDL, to the Florida Flame, on February 16. He was recalled and activated again on February 21, and saw his first significant NBA game action on the following night, scoring 13 points and grabbing 9 rebounds in 23 minutes.
He appeared in 32 games and averaged 11.8 minutes, 5.2 points, and 1.2 rebounds during these contests. Green left marks on the league with his highlight plays including a shot clock beating half court three against Indiana and two SportsCenter top play dunks in the closing seconds in two games against the Toronto Raptors.


==== 2006–07 season ====
Over the off-season, Green aimed at improving all aspects of his game in order to gain playing time. He had shown flashes of his capability during the end of the 2005–06 season, but started off the 2006–07 season slowly, earning a somewhat limited role and playing time behind captain Paul Pierce, and swingman Wally Szczerbiak. With injuries to Szczerbiak and Pierce, his playing time increased, but he was unable to nail down a starting role. Green started his first-ever game early December against the Philadelphia 76ers, but then lost his job to a returning Szczerbiak. Green finished the 2006–07 season averaging 10.4 points, 2.6 rebounds and 1.0 assists per game.
On February 17, 2007, Green won the 2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, beating out Nate Robinson, Tyrus Thomas, and Dwight Howard.
The season was going very well for Green. On March 16, 2007, he scored a career-high 25 points in a Celtics loss to the Dallas Mavericks, and on April 10, 2007, Green topped that with 33 points (12-22 FG, 4-5 3FG) at Atlanta.On July 31, 2007 it was made official that Green was to be traded along with Al Jefferson, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and draft picks, to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Kevin Garnett.


=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2007–2008) ===
At Minnesota, Green found himself stuck on the bench behind a number of players at his same position. In early January 2008, Green's agent asked the Timberwolves to trade his client.At the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, Green opened the competition with a dunk he called "The Birthday Cake" in which he blew out a birthday candle on a cupcake set on the back of the rim while dunking. He followed that up with an alley-oop two-handed windmill. His first dunk of the second round was an alley-oop from behind the basket which he put between his legs before dunking. His final dunk of the night was a between-the-legs one-handed slam that he performed after taking off his shoes. He ended up finishing second to Dwight Howard, after Howard received seventy-eight percent of the votes cast by fans through text message.


=== Houston Rockets (2008) ===
On February 21, 2008, Green was traded to his hometown team Houston Rockets for Kirk Snyder, a 2010 second-round draft pick, and cash considerations. He was subsequently released by the Rockets on March 8 and became an unrestricted free agent in July.


=== Dallas Mavericks (2008–2009) ===
On July 1, 2008, Green signed with the Dallas Mavericks. His agent Colin Bryant told Fox 26 Sports, "We have a verbal agreement with Dallas on a one year contract, We talked to a number of teams and there is more money out there, but this is the best situation for Gerald at this point in his career."Green was not supposed to go to the summer league, but chose to go to learn the plays and get a feeling of the Mavericks organization early and not let his chance slip away. In the Vegas Summer League he averaged an underwhelming 13.3 ppg and 3.8 rpg on 38% shooting from the field. On a bright note, he was 43% from beyond the arc. Following the Vegas Summer League, the Mavericks and Green participated in the Rocky Mountain Revue, a summer league held in Salt Lake City, Utah. There in just 25.8 mpg Green averaged 17.7 ppg to go with 2.7 rpg, 1.8 apg, 1 spg, .5 bpg, and a respectable 2.2 topg. This time around, Green shot a much more impressive 45%, including going 12 for 26 from behind the three point line (46%), and 28-31 from the free throw line (90%). His overall performance was enough to earn him All-Revue Team honors.


=== Outside the NBA (2009–2011) ===
Green signed with PBC Lokomotiv Kuban of Russia on December 2009. The Lokomotiv Kuban waived him on June 2010. He then was named to the Los Angeles Lakers roster for the 2010 NBA Summer League. After the Summer League, Green signed with BC Krasnye Krylya, also a Russian team.

Green started for the Suns when fellow guards Goran Dragić and Eric Bledsoe were injured during their respective periods in November 2013. He received more starting time with the Suns after Bledsoe had a major knee injury during January, February, and early March 2014. Throughout this period, Green would take over some games as being the team's leading scorer, including a 112–107 overtime victory against the Denver Nuggets, in which he'd record a then-career-high 36 points against them, which included making 8 of the team's 13 points in overtime.On March 6, 2014, Green recorded a new career-high 41 points, including a career-high 8 made three-pointers, in a 128–122 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.

As a result, he finished fourth in the NBA Most Improved Player Award behind Anthony Davis, Lance Stephenson, and Green's teammate Goran Dragić.

Career statistics and player information from NBA.com, or Basketball-Reference.comReggie Lewis (November 21, 1965 – July 27, 1993) was an American professional basketball player for the National Basketball Association's Boston Celtics from 1987 to 1993.


== Biography ==


=== Personal life ===
Born in Baltimore, Maryland, Lewis attended high school at Dunbar High School, where he played basketball alongside NBA players Muggsy Bogues, David Wingate, and Reggie Williams. The 1981–82 Dunbar Poets finished the season at 29–0 during Lewis' junior season and finished 31–0 during his senior season, and were ranked first in the nation by USA Today.Lewis attended Northeastern University in Boston. Over his four years at Northeastern, Lewis scored 2,708 points, still the all-time record at the university. His Northeastern teams won the ECAC North all four seasons and played in the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament every year. The 1983–84 Huskies advanced to the second round of the NCAA Tournament, falling one point shy of the Sweet 16 when Rolando Lamb scored at the buzzer to lift VCU over the Huskies.
His uniform number was retired and hangs in tribute in Matthews Arena (the home of Northeastern University's men's basketball team and the Celtics' original home arena in 1946). As a Celtic, he and his family lived in Dedham, Massachusetts. He was a second cousin of PJ Dozier, who wore the jersey number 35 as a member of the Oklahoma City Thunder in honor of Lewis.


=== Boston Celtics ===
Lewis was drafted in the first round, 22nd overall, by the Boston Celtics in the 1987 NBA draft. The Celtics were looking to add some youth to the team, especially for the aging "Big 3" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish. This need became more urgent after Len Bias, the 2nd overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft, died of a cocaine overdose.As a rookie, Lewis played sporadically, averaging only 8.3 minutes per game under coach K. C. Jones. By his second season, thanks in part to a new coach (and an injury to Celtics star Larry Bird) Lewis averaged over 30 minutes per game and scored 18.5 points per game. Lewis was selected to play in his first and only NBA All-Star Game held in Orlando, Florida, 1992. He played 15 minutes, scoring 7 points and grabbing 4 rebounds.
He averaged 20.8 points per game in each of his last two seasons with the Celtics, and finished with a career average of 17.6 points per contest.His no. 35 jersey was retired by the Celtics as a memorial to him, making him one of only two Celtics to have a retired number without winning a championship with the team, the other player being Ed Macauley.


=== Death and legacy ===
On April 29, 1993, in a playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets, Lewis suddenly collapsed on the court and remained on the ground for several seconds. After he finally got up, he looked perplexed and dazed as he headed to the Celtics bench. Lewis returned briefly to the game later, but was eventually pulled due to dizziness and shortness of breath. He left the contest having scored 17 points in 13 minutes of action in what turned out to be his final NBA game.The following day, Lewis checked into New England Baptist Hospital, where he underwent a series of tests by more than a dozen heart specialists, who the Celtics called their "dream team" of doctors. Lewis was diagnosed with "focal cardiomyopathy", a disease of the heart muscle that can cause irregular heartbeat and heart failure. Lewis was told his condition was most likely career-ending. However, he later sought a second opinion from Dr. Gilbert Mudge at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who diagnosed Lewis with neurocardiogenic syncope, a less serious non-fatal condition instead. As a result, Lewis began working out in preparation for returning for the 1994 season. Mudge was later cleared of any wrongdoing, and he insisted he had never authorized Lewis to resume workouts.On July 27, 1993, during an off-season practice at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, Lewis suffered sudden cardiac death on the basketball court. He was 27 years old. James Crowley, a Brandeis University police officer who happened upon the gym on a routine patrol, and another Brandeis University police officer attempted to revive Lewis by using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but they were unsuccessful.Lewis is buried in an unmarked grave in Forest Hills Cemetery in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts.His death was attributed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a structural heart defect that is considered the most common cause of death in young athletes.Following Lewis' death, questions were raised about whether he had used cocaine, and whether cocaine use had contributed to his death. The Wall Street Journal reported that physicians "suspected that cocaine killed Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis...but they were thwarted by actions by his family and a 'dismissive' policy toward drugs by the NBA." The Journal added the following:

Whether Mr. Lewis died from a heart damaged by cocaine -- as many doctors suspected then and now -- cannot be definitively shown. What is evident: The official cause of death, a heart damaged by a common-cold virus, is a medically nonsensical finding by a coroner who was under intense pressure from the Lewis family to exclude any implication of drug use.
The Boston Celtics responded by expressing sadness about the "vicious attack on Reggie Lewis and his family" and threatening "to file a $100 million lawsuit against the reporter, The Wall Street Journal and its parent company, Dow Jones and Co. Inc." Dr. Gilbert Mudge, a doctor who treated Lewis, was sued for malpractice in connection with Lewis' death; in written responses to questions from the attorneys for Donna Harris-Lewis, Mudge said that "16 days before Lewis collapsed from a heart attack in 1993, he acknowledged having used cocaine, but said he had stopped." On the other hand, the doctor who performed the autopsy on Lewis testified that the scarring on his heart was inconsistent with cocaine use, and other doctors reached the same conclusion though they "stopped short of saying he never used drugs." Also, Lewis's heart tissue tested positive for adenovirus during his autopsy.After Lewis' death, the Reggie Lewis Track and Athletic Center was opened in Roxbury, Boston. The center was funded partially by Lewis and has hosted major indoor track and field competitions, the Boston Indoor Games, home basketball games for Roxbury Community College, and Northeastern University track and field events.On March 22, 1995, the Boston Celtics retired Lewis' jersey. Lewis had worn the number 35 for his entire career. During the ceremony, former teammate Dee Brown made a speech while two other former teammates, Sherman Douglas and Xavier McDaniel, held up Lewis' framed jersey.Lewis' contract remained on the Celtics' salary cap for two full seasons after his death because at the time the NBA did not have a provision to void contracts in the event an active player died; NBA Commissioner David Stern said that the remaining NBA teams should approve an exemption for Lewis' contract but the rest of the league, many of whom had spent years or even decades losing to the Celtics on the court, said that they would do no such thing to help Boston. The rules have since been changed so that a similar case would result in a deceased player's contract being paid by league insurance.

The Journal's Reggie Lewis Bombshell
Remembering Reggie Lewis - at nba.com
Remembering Reggie LewisLuke Cameron Harangody (born January 2, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for Divina Seguros Joventut of the Liga ACB. He completed his college career at the University of Notre Dame in 2010. He is the only men's player in the history of the Big East Conference to average 20 points and 10 rebounds per game in conference play for his career. He was the 2008 Big East Player of the Year, and was named to the second team on the 2008 Associated Press All-America team. He is also the first Notre Dame men's player to be a three-time first-team All-Big East selection (and just 11th overall) (2008–2010), and the first men's player to lead the conference in both scoring and rebounding in consecutive seasons (2008 and 2009).Harangody considered entering the 2009 NBA draft, but withdrew his name to return to Notre Dame for his senior season. Harangody ended his Notre Dame career as the only player to have over 2000 points and 1000 rebounds.


== Early years ==
Growing up in Schererville, Indiana, Harangody, the son of a former Indiana University football player, had an intense sibling rivalry with his brother Ty, who is 20 months older and was one grade ahead of him in school. The two began with basketball games on a mini-hoop in Harangody's room, which ended when they were kicked out for shaking the light fixtures. The games then moved to a court that their father set up in the basement, and from there to the backyard once they outgrew the basement. Their father soon banned them from the backyard because their one-on-one games almost invariably ended in fistfights, but that only moved their rivalry to local parks. Bigger and stronger, Ty won most of their games; Harangody would later say about those days, "I still look back on that as where most of my competitive nature comes from. To beat him, I'd go all out, all the time." Eventually, the brothers' athletic paths split. Ty followed in their father's footsteps as a football player, eventually earning a scholarship to IU as a tight end; his career was ended by a torn ACL in his sophomore year. Harangody grew 3 inches as a high school freshman and opted for basketball.Harangody starred at Andrean High School in nearby Merrillville. In his last two high school seasons, he averaged over 20 points and 10 rebounds, was named as the top player in Northwest Indiana by at least one media outlet in each season, and received All-State recognition in Indiana in both seasons.


== College career ==


=== Freshman season ===
Despite Harangody's credentials, he had considerable doubts about his ability to play in the Big East, and much of Notre Dame's recruitment consisted of convincing him he was good enough to play in the conference.
After a double-double against Butler in the second game of the season, Irish head coach Mike Brey considered adding Harangody to the starting lineup, but Harangody hesitated and Brey decided to wait until Big East play. Harangody would go on to start the team's final 16 games.Harangody went on to average 11.2 points and 6.2 rebounds that season, and was named to the Big East All-Rookie first team. However, conditioning proved to be a problem for him that season; he gained weight during the season (not typical for college athletes), and he played more than 30 minutes only once as a freshman. His conditioning caught up with him in the NCAA Tournament. He played only 17 minutes in Notre Dame's first-round loss to Winthrop, and finished with 4 points and one rebound. About that game, he would later remember that "It was hard to get up and down the court. I hit that wall and there was nothing I could do to get out of it. I never wanted to feel like that again." He then had dinner with his parents shortly after the game, an event which his father clearly remembered in an interview the following season: "On the spot, he says, 'I've got to do something.' He rededicated himself from the minute they lost that game."


=== Sophomore season ===

His rededication began with a change in diet; he and the team's trainer worked on a nutrition program that limited his intake of fried foods and carbohydrates. Harangody also increased the intensity of his workout regimen, in both cardiovascular work and weight training. The work paid off in his sophomore season; his body fat content dropped from 14% at the end of his freshman season to 8% by the end of the 2007–08 season. Harangody also took more of a leadership role on the team, notably berating several of the team's freshmen for giggling in the locker room after a January 19, 2008 loss to Georgetown.Harangody ended the season averaging 20.4 points and 10.6 rebounds, which made him the Big East's leading scorer and second-leading rebounder. In contrast to his early doubts about his ability to play in the Big East, he had even better numbers in Big East play, with averages of 23.3 points and 11.3 rebounds, which led the conference in both categories. This also made him one of only five players in the previous decade to average 22 points and 11 rebounds in conference play for a BCS conference team.  His scoring and leadership led the Irish to a 14–4 conference record and 24–7 regular season record. The Irish also became the first team in Big East men's basketball history to go unbeaten at home in conference play in consecutive seasons. Although the Irish lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to Marquette, Notre Dame earned their second straight NCAA Tournament bid as a #5 seed. The Irish beat George Mason in the first round and went out in the second to Washington State.
After the season, Harangody was named the conference Player of the Year, and was also named to the 1st Team All Big East squad. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.


=== Junior season ===

Harangody never considered declaring for the 2008 NBA draft. With Harangody and fellow All-Big East first-teamer Kyle McAlarney leading an experienced team, the Irish were expected to make a deep run in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, with Dick Vitale naming the Irish #6 in his preseason rankings and Andy Katz placing the Irish in a "next tier" of teams that he effectively ranked from 8th to 16th.However, Notre Dame had to deal with a possible threat to Harangody's college eligibility during the 2008 offseason. A Boston company, Cellular Services Worldwide, had obtained public domain photos of Harangody and Irish quarterback Jimmy Clausen and used them in an advertisement on a Notre Dame fan site on the Web. Such a use of images of players is a violation of NCAA rules. The school immediately issued a cease and desist letter to the company, which satisfied NCAA requirements and ensured the players' eligibility.The Fighting Irish finished a disappointing 21–15, losing in the Final Four of the NIT to Penn State after climbing as high as #7 in the polls during the season.


=== Senior season ===

After declaring for the 2009 NBA draft, Harangody withdrew and returned for his senior year at Notre Dame.The Irish rebounded to reach the Big East semi-finals and the NCAA Tournament.  Harangody was named All-Big East for the third year in a row and the All-American team for the third year in a row, making him the first Notre Dame player to be named an All-American 3 years in a row in basketball since Kevin O'Shea.

Notre Dame Fighting Irish bioRandy Foye (born September 24, 1983) is a color analyst of the YES Network and a former American professional basketball player. He played collegiately at Villanova University. He was selected seventh overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves where he began his career.


== High school career ==
Foye attended East Side High School in Newark, where he was selected as New Jersey Player of the Year, before being recruited by Jay Wright and Villanova.Considered a four-star recruit by Scout.com, Foye was listed as the No. 7 shooting guard and the No. 37 player in the nation in 2002.


== College career ==
Foye, along with Allan Ray, Curtis Sumpter, and Jason Fraser were proclaimed as the players to lead the Villanova Wildcats back to a championship. Foye and Ray reached the Elite Eight of the 2006 NCAA Tournament, playing with the other three starters in the four-guard offense (Kyle Lowry, Mike Nardi and Will Sheridan), while Sumpter was sidelined as a medical redshirt with a knee injury.
Foye's college career was productive and eventful, but his senior season was by far the best statistically.
In the 2005 NCAA Tournament, Foye averaged 20 points in three games, before a heartbreaking loss to #1 seed and eventual national champion North Carolina in which Foye scored a career-high 28 points. He was named third-team all Big East that year.
In 2006, Foye won the honor of Big East Player of the Year, beating out teammate Allan Ray, Connecticut star Rudy Gay and the league's leading scorer Quincy Douby of Rutgers.
Villanova tied for the Big East regular season championship with Uconn and split their two games with the Huskies, winning the one played at home, in what some called the biggest Villanova win in over 20 years. Their final Big East regular season record was 14–2 in what some called the toughest conference ever. Overall, their record was 28–5. In the NCAA Tournament in 2006, Foye continued to be Villanova's biggest scoring threat. He had 24 points in their second-round game against Arizona in a winning effort. Foye scored a team-high 25 points in his final game as a Wildcat, on March 26, 2006, a 75–62 loss to Florida in the Elite Eight.As a senior Foye averaged 20.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, 3.3 assists, 1.4 steals, and 0.6 blocks, with a field goal percentage of 41.1%.


== Professional career ==


=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2006–2009) ===
On June 28, 2006, Foye was selected seventh overall in the 2006 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics, but was immediately traded to the Portland Trail Blazers, and later traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He entered his rookie year on a team that already had six guards on its roster. Off-season free-agent acquisition Mike James was slated to start at point guard, Foye's most likely position in the NBA, with Ricky Davis at small forward and Rashad McCants at shooting guard. This left Foye to battle for minutes on a bench full of guards. In November, Foye's first month as a professional basketball player, Timberwolves coach Dwane Casey only gave Foye an average of 14.6 minutes per game. Foye, however, was productive whenever he was given minutes. He scored in double digits in each of the four games he was given 20 or more minutes of playing time.

In December 2007, Foye's minutes per game average increased to 19.6 and he scored in double digits in half of the T-Wolves' games. However, after Dwane Casey's firing after the Twolves' 40th game (when they had a record of 20–20), the Twolves struggled, yet the young star played well when given minutes. In March, Foye saw nearly 24 minutes of playing time a night, and in April saw almost 27 minutes a night to perform.
Foye played all 82 games (12 starts) in his rookie season and averaged 22.9 minutes, 10.1 points, 2.7 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 0.65 steals, and 0.3 blocks per game. Among rookies, he ranked fifth in scoring (10.1 ppg), eighth in field goal percentage (43.4%), third in 3-point shooting percentage (37%), third in free throw shooting percentage (85%), 5th in assists (2.8 apg) and 9th in steals (0.65 spg). He was one of the most consistent rookie performers and was selected to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.On December 23, 2008, Foye pulled down 16 rebounds to set a career high and break the team record of 15 for a guard set by Isaiah Rider in 1996. Foye also had 26 points and 1 assist in the 99–93 loss to the San Antonio Spurs.


=== Washington Wizards (2009–2010) ===
On June 23, 2009, Foye, along with Mike Miller, was traded to the Washington Wizards for Oleksiy Pecherov, Etan Thomas, Darius Songaila, and a first round draft pick.On January 9, 2010, Foye was fined $10,000 by the Washington Wizards for participating in Gilbert Arenas' antics before a game on January 5, 2010 against the Philadelphia 76ers. Arenas was being investigated for a prior incident involving guns in the Wizards' locker room, but made light of the accusations by pointing his finger at his teammates, as if he were shooting them. His teammates were photographed smiling and laughing with him.

On July 8, 2010, Foye was signed by the Los Angeles Clippers.


=== Utah Jazz (2012–2013) ===

=== Denver Nuggets (2013–2016) ===
On July 10, 2013, Foye was traded to the Denver Nuggets as part of a three-team trade involving the Jazz and the Golden State Warriors. On February 3, 2014, Foye hit the first game-winning shot of his eight-year NBA career, making a 30-foot three-pointer as time expired to claim a 116–115 win over the Los Angeles Clippers.On December 23, 2015, Foye scored a season-high 31 points and made seven three-pointers in a 104–96 win over the Phoenix Suns.


=== Oklahoma City Thunder (2016) ===

My Amazing Journey – Randy FoyeOrien Randolph Greene II (born February 4, 1982) is an American former professional basketball player. His first two professional seasons were spent with the NBA's Boston Celtics and Indiana Pacers, respectively. He played briefly with the Sacramento Kings in 2007, and with the New Jersey Nets in 2011.


== College career ==
A highly touted prospect coming out of high school, the 6'4" (1.93 m) point guard originally chose to attend the University of Florida, his hometown college. However, after a couple of years Greene became dissatisfied with his playing time and decided to transfer to the University of Louisiana at Lafayette where he became known in the Sun Belt Conference for his aggressive play, winning the Defensive Player of the Year award his senior season.
However, in 2007, an NCAA investigation found that Greene had relied on 15 hours of correspondence courses taken through another institution in order to remain eligible for the 2004 spring semester and the entire 2004-05 academic year. NCAA rules do not allow student-athletes to use correspondence courses taken from another institution to remain eligible.  According to the NCAA, this was an "obvious error" that should have been caught right away, but the school's then-compliance coordinator  director of academic services and registrar all failed to catch it.  When school officials learned about the violations, they vacated every game in which Greene participated—43 games in all, including NCAA tournament appearances in 2004 and 2005—and scrubbed Greene's records from the books.  The NCAA accepted Louisiana-Lafayette's penalties and also imposed two years' probation.


== Professional career ==
Greene was drafted in 2005 NBA Draft with the 53rd overall pick by the Boston Celtics.
Greene began his pro career as backup to Delonte West. His status as the backup point guard was cemented by a season-ending injury to Dan Dickau and the trade of Marcus Banks to the Minnesota Timberwolves.
On March 29, 2006, Greene was suspended by the Boston Celtics for one game after he was charged with driving his sport utility vehicle at more than 90 mph (140 km/h) on a street in suburban Boston.
On June 30, 2006, Greene was waived by the Boston Celtics. He was claimed off waivers by the Indiana Pacers, and played for their 2006-2007 team.Greene was used very sparingly in his season with the Pacers. He played in only 41 games, averaging 6.2 minutes per game; quite a drop off compared to playing in all but 2 games the previous year with the Celtics and averaging 15.4 minutes per game. The Pacers brought in Darrell Armstrong (from Dallas) and Keith McLeod (from Golden State) to compete with Greene for minutes at point guard. With Jamaal Tinsley holding the starting position, Greene fell to fourth on the depth chart, which resulted in very little playing time. Greene signed with the Sacramento Kings on August 30, 2007. He was waived by the Kings November 15, 2007 after playing just 7 games.Greene signed a three-month contract with the Australian National Basketball League's New Zealand Breakers in late November 2007. He was signed to replace Wayne Turner, who was out for the season.In 2010 Greene has been banned for two years for trying to dupe drug testers, backdated to March 12, 2009.He later played for the Utah Flash of the NBA Development League. On February 1, 2011 Greene re-joined the NBA as he signed a 10-day contract with the New Jersey Nets. Afterwards, he rejoined the Flash.
On November 10, 2011 Orien Greene signed to play basketball for the Halifax Rainmen of the NBL. Shortly afterwards, he joined the Los Angeles D-Fenders of the NBA D-League.In October 2012, Greene signed with the Milwaukee Bucks. He was waived by the team later that month. Later that month, he was re-acquired by the Los Angeles D-Fenders. On February 25, 2013, Greene was traded to the Reno Bighorns.In October 2013, he joined Al Alhy Benghazi of Libya.
In December 2014, he joined Fuerza Regia of the Mexican Liga Nacional de Baloncesto Profesional.On December 31, 2016, Greene signed with Guaros de Lara of the Liga Profesional de Baloncesto.

Louisiana-Lafayette bio of Greene
It Hasn't Been Easy Being GreeneEugene Michael Guarilia (September 13, 1937 – November 20, 2016) was an American basketball player who played four seasons for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
He attended Holy Rosary Grammar School and Duryea High School. Guarilia played freshman basketball for Potomac State College, a junior college in Keyser, West Virginia. He established a State Conference freshman record by scoring 595 points in 1953.
A 6'5" (1.96 m) forward Guarilia played for the George Washington University varsity basketball team beginning in the 1956-1957 season. He took the place of All-America Joe Holup who went on to play for the Syracuse Nationals. In February 1957 he was averaging 17.1 points per game and was #6 in the NCAA in rebounding. In the twenty games he had played, Guarilia had snatched 353 rebounds. He was selected to the all Southern Conference basketball team in February 1958.
Guarilia was selected by the Boston Celtics in the second round of the 1959 NBA Draft.  Guarilia appeared in 129 games for the Celtics over four seasons (1959–1963), averaging 3.2 points and 2.3 rebounds per game.  He earned four NBA championship rings in his brief career.
In December 1959 Boston placed Guarilia on its farm out list to trim their roster to the required 10 player limit. Though officially off the Celtics' roster, he remained in Boston to be available if other players were injured. Red Auerbach considered rotating Guarilia on the active list with one of the other Celtics rookies, like John Richter. The coach said that this move could be done in accordance with NBA rules.
Guarilia was particularly effective in Boston's 1961-62 NBA championship victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. In the final moments of regulation time, in the decisive seventh game, he stopped Elgin Baylor. The Celtics went on to win the game in overtime.
A new NBA rule allowed Guarilia to become the 11th man on the Boston roster in the (1962-63) NBA Championship versus the Lakers. On September 25, 1963 the Celtics placed Guarilia on waivers to reduce their playing squad to 16 players.


== Post NBA ==
Guarilia went on to teach health and physical education for many years at Duryea High School, which became Northeast High School, which in turn became Pittston Area Senior High School.Pittston Area dedicated its court to Guarilia in January 2015, when it painted two shamrocks and Guarilia's No. 20 on the court.Guaralia died on November 20, 2016.

Career statistics and player information from Basketball-Reference.comAnthony Lavelli, Jr. (July 11, 1926 – January 8, 1998) was an American professional basketball player and musician.  He averaged 6.9 points per game during his two-year National Basketball Association (NBA) career (1949–1951) while also providing half-time entertainment with his accordion performances.


== College ==
A native of Somerville, Massachusetts, Lavelli attended Yale University as a music student and was a member of Skull and Bones.  He aspired to compose musical comedies after he graduated.  He wrote over a dozen songs while in college, with titles like "I Want a Helicopter"  and "You're the Boppiest Bee-Bop", and he also appeared as an accordion soloist for the New Haven Symphony Orchestra.  As a senior, he applied to the Juilliard School, the Curtis Institute of Music, and the New England Conservatory of Music.However, Lavelli's musical talents were often overshadowed by his achievements on the basketball court. Lavelli claimed that he had only learned basketball as a teenager to impress his friends, who were mostly apathetic to his music.  Nevertheless, he would become one of Yale's all-time greatest players. A 6'3" forward with an accurate one-handed hook shot, he scored 1,964 points in four years and graduated as the fourth highest-scorer in college basketball history.  He also earned four All-American team selections and one Player of the Year award during his college career.  Upon graduating, he was selected by the Boston Celtics as the fourth overall pick in the 1949 BAA draft.


=== College statistics ===


== Professional basketball ==
Despite his athletic accomplishments, Lavelli's first love was music, and he initially refused to sign with the Celtics so that he could enroll at Juilliard. Eventually, however, based on suggestions made by sports executive Leo Ferris, Lavelli proposed to join the team on the condition that they would pay him an extra $125 per game to play his accordion during half-time breaks at Boston Garden and certain visitors' arenas. The Celtics conceded to his demands.
Lavelli made his Celtics debut on November 24, 1949 in a game against the Fort Wayne Pistons. He tallied 20 points in his first game, and would average 8.8 points per game over the course of the 1949–50 NBA season. However, he received much more attention for his half-time accordion performances; indeed, some basketball historians have credited Lavelli's mini-concerts for saving the early Celtics franchise, which was in danger of folding due to lack of fans and money. In a typical performance, Lavelli would greet the fans and play "Granada", "Lady of Spain", and other musical pieces before dashing off to the Celtics' locker room. He usually played in his basketball jersey, as he had little time to change his clothes.  The Celtics unfortunately finished last in their division that season, but one newspaper joked that the team "doubtless [found] his music soothing".Lavelli signed with the rival New York Knicks prior to the start of the 1950–51 NBA season.  He averaged 3.3 points per game with the Knicks and participated in their playoff run, which ended in the 1951 NBA Finals at the hands of the Rochester Royals.  However, Lavelli had joined the Knicks specifically so that he would be close to Juilliard, and he finally began taking courses there during his tenure with the team.During the mid-1950s, Lavelli played with the College All-Stars, who primarily served as opponents to the Harlem Globetrotters, and his accordion performances became a fixture of the Globetrotters’ halftime shows.


== Post-basketball career ==
After retiring from basketball in the late 1950s, Lavelli embarked on a long career as a songwriter and nightclub performer. He released two records during his life: All-American Accordionist and Accordion Classics. In 1998, he suffered a heart attack at his home in Laconia, New Hampshire and died shortly afterwards.


== Trivia ==
Lavelli twice appeared on the television program Toast of the Town, which was later renamed The Ed Sullivan Show.
Lavelli's cousin, Dante Lavelli, played for the Cleveland Browns in the 1940s and 1950s and was later inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame.

=== Boston Celtics (2014–2017) ===


==== 2014–15 season ====
On June 26, 2014, Young was selected with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics. On July 10, 2014, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Celtics. Injuries forced Young to miss the summer league, most of training camp and part of the early season. Because of these setbacks, Young spent much of the season driving back and forth between Boston and Maine, playing for the Red Claws in order to receive consistent playing time. He had 11 D-League assignments in total during his rookie season. Playing in the D-League was something Young was originally against, but grew to love in time, even urging the Celtics to send him to Maine during the month of December. Young finally got an opportunity to shine for the Celtics on January 5, 2015, scoring a season-high 13 points in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets. In light of this performance, Young had a solid run of playing time in Brad Stevens' rotation, averaging 3.8 points in 12.9 minutes per game between January 5 and March 6. However, following that string of opportunities, Young managed just four more appearances to close out the regular season, and failed to appear in any of the Celtics' four playoff games against the Cleveland Cavaliers.In 19 games for the Red Claws in 2014–15, Young averaged 20.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game.


==== 2015–16 season ====
In July 2015, Young joined the Celtics for the 2015 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 9.4 points and 3.4 rebounds in five games. His performance was considered underwhelming, as he shot just 27.1% from the field and 22.7% from three-point range. He subsequently played the least amount of preseason minutes of anyone who made the final 2015–16 opening night roster. Despite this, on October 30, the Celtics exercised their third-year team option on Young's rookie scale contract, extending the contract through the 2016–17 season. His early 2015–16 season opportunities mirrored his rookie season, as he spent five days with the Red Claws between November 3 and 9 on two different assignments before finally making his season debut for the Celtics on November 10, playing in the final 49 seconds of the team's 99–83 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. He received three more assignments to Maine following this. After playing in three games for the Celtics between November 24 and December 3, he almost got on a plane from San Antonio to Maine on December 4, but was informed not to minutes before boarding; the Celtics needed Young as insurance because of a quad injury to Avery Bradley. Young ultimately did not play for the Celtics against the Spurs on December 5. He went on to appear in seven of the team's next eight games, averaging 14.3 minutes per game over that stretch. Young received seven more assignments to the Red Claws in 2016 and appeared in three of the Celtics' six playoff games against the Atlanta Hawks.In 16 games for the Red Claws in 2015–16, Young averaged 14.8 points, 5.6 rebounds, 1.9 assists and 1.0 steals per game.


==== 2016–17 season ====

In July 2016, Young re-joined the Celtics for the 2016 NBA Summer League, where he averaged 7.5 points and 2.8 rebounds in six games. On October 24, 2016, Young was retained by the Celtics for the 2016–17 season. On November 12, 2016, in the Celtics' ninth game of the season, Young scored a season-high 12 points in a 105–99 win over the Indiana Pacers. Young went unassigned in 2016–17 but only managed 29 games during the regular season.


=== 2017 off-season ===
In July 2017, Young became a free agent and joined the New Orleans Pelicans for the 2017 NBA Summer League. On September 6, 2017, he signed a training camp contract with the Milwaukee Bucks. He was waived by the Bucks on October 5, 2017.


=== Wisconsin Herd (2017–2018) ===

Over his years in the league, his three-point shooting has improved to the point where he's a league-average three-point threat. His teammate, Kemba Walker, describes the energy he brings to the game: "It's exciting. It's energizing. He just gets everybody going. Gets us going, gets the crowd going. Like I said, we just kinda feed off him. He just does so many great things. And propels our defense each and every night."

E'Twaun Moore on TwitterDeyonta Davis (born December 2, 1996) is an American professional basketball player who currently plays for the Santa Cruz Warriors of the NBA G League. He won the Mr. Basketball of Michigan in 2015 and appeared in the McDonald's All-American Boys Game the same year. He played one season of college basketball for the Michigan State Spartans before being drafted by the Boston Celtics with the 31st overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft before being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies on draft night.


== High school career ==
Davis attended Muskegon High School in Muskegon, Michigan. In his final season, he recorded 4 points and 12 rebounds in the state regional finals, as Muskegon escaped Hudsonville in quadruple-overtime. He played his final game for the Big Reds on March 24, 2015, in a 52-75 quarterfinals loss to Everett High School. He contributed 12 points, 8 rebounds, and 5 blocks. It was played only three miles from the Michigan State University campus. Davis said after the loss, "It was very important [to help my team advance]. We came out ready to play, but the game just didn't go our way." The game was attended by MSU assistant basketball coach Dwayne Stephens, who helped recruit him to his team. Davis also got the chance to meet Spartans players before competing. As Muskegon's star left his team, head coach Keith Guy said, "The future is bright. Two games don't define his career."By the end of the season, Davis was named Mr. Basketball of Michigan for 2015. In the balloting, he earned a total of 5,223 points. Arthur Hill's Eric Davis and Everett's Trevor Manuel finished after him, getting 3,757 and 2,837 points respectively. The award was won by two straight players from Muskegon High School, Deshaun Thrower winning in 2014. Big Red coach Guy complemented his team, saying, "To have another kid win it for the second consecutive year, it shows how far our program has come the last three years." Davis was given his personal Mr. Basketball trophy between the quarters of the Michigan state title game, in which Saginaw's Arthur Hill played against Detroit's Western International. He said in disappointment, "I'd much rather be on the floor playing right now."On April 1, 2015, Davis competed in the 2015 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, playing for the West team. He played alongside the likes of Stephen Zimmerman and Jalen Brunson and against Diamond Stone and Cheick Diallo. Davis finished the game with 6 points and 9 rebounds, leading his team in the latter category. In January, when he was named to the game, Bank Hoops scout Steve Bell said, "This is huge for West Michigan." The forward was the first player from that region to appear at the stage since Matt Steigenga in 1988.


== College career ==
Davis played one season at Michigan State, averaging 7.5 points per game, 5.5 rebounds per game, and 1.6 blocks per game. Davis started 16 of the final 17 games of the season for the Spartans. Davis was a key part to Michigan States record setting start to the season, Big Ten Tournament Championship, and MSU's 2nd overall final rank in the AP Poll. He set the school freshman record with 64 blocked shots, second-most in a single season in program history.

Davis declared for the draft on April 12, 2016. Davis and teammate Denzel Valentine were selected to attend the 2016 NBA Combine. Davis hired Bill Duffy as his agent.Jonathan Givony from DraftExpress had the following to say on Davis: "Although he doesn't produce eye-popping numbers, his ability to switch on screens and stay in front of players big and small has been huge for the Spartans, especially late in games. ... Casual fans should try and get to know him better as the Tournament moves on, provided Michigan State is able to advance, as there's a pretty good chance the NBA will be calling for him when the season is over."While Davis was consistently labelled as a lottery selection all the way until the day of the draft, he was chosen by the Boston Celtics with the 31st overall pick. He therefore became the first green room invitee to not hear his name get called in the first round since Maciej Lampe in 2003's NBA draft.

=== NBA draft ===
After finishing his college career, Jae Crowder decided to enter the 2012 NBA draft, where he was projected to be a second round draft pick. Crowder was taken 34th overall by the Cleveland Cavaliers; however, a draft night-trade with the Mavericks sent him to Dallas, along with 24th overall pick Jared Cunningham and 33rd overall pick Bernard James, in exchange for 17th overall pick Tyler Zeller and Kelenna Azubuike. He was officially signed on July 20, 2012 on a non-guaranteed two-year contract, like all second round draft picks. His Marquette teammate Darius Johnson-Odom was also drafted with the 55th overall pick.


=== Dallas Mavericks (2012–2014) ===


==== Rookie season ====
Due to his strong showing in NBA Summer League and preseason games, he was described as "the steal of the NBA draft", averaging 11.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, 1.9 steals, 1.6 assists and 0.8 blocks in 22 minutes per game in the preseason and 16.6 points, 1.6 assists, 5.4 rebounds, 0.8 blocks, 2.0 steals and 41.7 percent shooting in Summer League, where he was also voted into the All-Summer League team. This strong showing raised expectations in the young player, as he was viewed as possibly the Mavericks' new franchise player and possibly a future All-Star.His stellar play earned him a spot in coach Rick Carlisle's rotation. He debuted in the season-opening win against the Los Angeles Lakers. After Dirk Nowitzki missed most of the early season with an arthroscopic knee surgery and starting small forward Shawn Marion was also injured, Crowder became the team's starting small forward. With Marion and Nowitzki's returns, Crowder's minutes decreased. His contribution started to dwindle a bit starting around the all-star break, when he admitted that he hit the "rookie wall". The Mavericks were never able to recover from Nowitzki's injury and missed the playoffs for the first time in 12 years, with Crowder averaging 5 points and 2.4 rebounds per game in 17.3 minutes.

Through the first half of the 2001–02 season, Johnson played 48 games for the Celtics and made 33 starts, as he averaged 6.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. He was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on February 20, 2002 along with Randy Brown, Milt Palacio and a first-round pick in exchange for Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk.


=== Phoenix Suns (2002–2005) ===
Johnson became a force with Phoenix as he averaged 14.0 points per game in his three and a half seasons with the Suns, becoming a clutch three-point shooter as he averaged 39.3% from the three-point arc during his tenure with the Suns.
During the 2004–05 campaign, Johnson and the Suns posted a 62–20 record. In the 2005 NBA Playoffs, Johnson required surgery to repair a left orbital bone fracture sustained following a dunk attempt against the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Johnson missed the remainder of the series against the Mavericks as well as the first two games of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. When he returned, Johnson wore a face mask for protection. The Suns fell to the eventual NBA champion Spurs, 4 games to 1.


=== Atlanta Hawks (2005–2012) ===

In the summer of 2005, Johnson became a highly touted restricted free agent and expressed a desire to leave the Suns to assume a larger role on the Atlanta Hawks. Johnson grew upset with Phoenix's initial offers to re-sign him feeling they were well below his market value. This rift eventually led to Johnson requesting the Suns not match Atlanta's $70 million offer.  On August 19, 2005, a deal was finalized and Johnson was involved in a sign-and-trade deal with the Hawks for Boris Diaw and two future first-round draft picks.In his first season as a Hawk, Johnson led Atlanta in several categories: points (20.2 per game), assists (6.5), steals (1.26), three-point field goals made (128) and minutes (40.7). He was one of only five players in the league to average at least 20 points and six assists in the 2005–06 season, along with Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Gilbert Arenas. Johnson was also the only Hawk to play in all 82 games in 2005–06.
On March 5, 2006, he was one of 23 NBA players named to the 2006–08 United States national team.
Johnson scored a career-high 42 points on March 7, 2006 against the Golden State Warriors and recorded a career-high 17 assists on March 13, 2006 against the Milwaukee Bucks.

His scoring average ranked ninth in the league.  Johnson also shot a career-best 47.1% from the field and was subsequently named to the 2007 Eastern Conference All-Star team, replacing the injured Jason Kidd.

In 2008, Johnson made the 2008 All-Star Game as a reserve.  He also was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice during the season. Johnson averaged 21.7 points per game on the season, leading the Hawks to their first playoff appearance in nine years. In Game 4 of the Hawks' first-round matchup against the Boston Celtics, Johnson scored 35 points, including 20 in the 4th quarter, leading the Hawks to a 97–92 victory.Despite finishing with the worst record (37-45) among the 2008 NBA Playoffs contingent, the Hawks played very even with the heavily favored and eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, taking the Eastern Conference No. 1 seed all the way to Game 7. The year marked a turning of the page for the Atlanta franchise, once considered among the least successful in pro sports.
The following year, Johnson registered his second career triple-double on December 23, 2008 in a Hawks win against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He eclipsed the 10,000-point plateau for his career with his first basket during a 110–107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on January 31, 2009, a bank shot assisted by Marvin Williams. On March 19, 2010, Johnson hit a game-winning buzzer beater in overtime against the Charlotte Bobcats.On July 8, 2010, Johnson re-signed with the Hawks to a six-year, $123.7 million contract, which, at the time, made him the NBA's highest-paid player. The signing occurred during one of the most star-studded free agency summers in league history, highlighted by LeBron James’"Decision" TV special. Among others who signed high-profile deals were Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, Amar'e Stoudemire, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Dirk Nowitzki.

After scoring 33 points in a road win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 2, he hit another game winner in double overtime two days later to beat the Washington Wizards.

College and NBA stats from basketballreference.comJeffrey Lynn Green (born August 28, 1986) is an American professional basketball player for the Houston Rockets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played three seasons of college basketball for the Georgetown Hoyas, before entering the 2007 NBA draft, where he was selected fifth overall by the Boston Celtics. He was subsequently traded to the Seattle SuperSonics (now known as the Oklahoma City Thunder). He spent 3½ seasons with the franchise before being traded back to the Celtics in February 2011, where he played until 2015 before being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies. In 2016, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers. He spent half a season with the Clippers before joining the Orlando Magic following the 2015–16 season. Green later joined the Cleveland Cavaliers and then the Washington Wizards.


== College career ==

Green was born in Cheverly, Maryland, to Jeffrey Green Sr. and Felicia Akingube. He attended Northwestern High School in Hyattsville, Maryland, where he led the NHS Wildcats to the state basketball championship in 2004.
Green was recruited to Georgetown University by coach Craig Esherick in 2003. Esherick was fired before Green arrived on campus and John Thompson III was hired as the new coach. The two top recruits of Esherick's tenure, Green and center Roy Hibbert, were the key components of Thompson's future success. Thompson stated in a Sports Illustrated interview: "You'll stop and think when I say this, but it's true: Jeff Green is the smartest player I've ever coached. You would know this better than most: that's a hell of a statement."Green won the 2005 Big East Rookie of the Year award along with Rudy Gay of the University of Connecticut. He was named to the All-Big East Second Team in 2006 along with teammate Roy Hibbert. In 2007, Green was named the Big East Player of the Year. He and Hibbert were unanimous selections to the All-Big East First Team. After his 30-point performance in the 2007 Big East Tournament semifinal against Notre Dame and his 21-point performance in the championship against Pittsburgh, Green was named Most Outstanding Player of the tournament, as the Hoyas won their first Big East title since 1989. He led the Hoyas to the Final Four of the 2007 NCAA Tournament, beating Belmont and Boston College in the first two rounds. Green beat Vanderbilt with a game-winning shot after getting away with travelling in the game's closing seconds as well as fearlessly leading the Hoyas to victory against No. 1 seed UNC in a stunning second-half comeback victory and bringing the Hoyas back to their first Final Four since Patrick Ewing led them to the 1985 National Championship game. The Hoyas eventually lost to Greg Oden and the Ohio State Buckeyes, bringing their remarkable title run to a close as well as Green's collegiate playing career, as he chose to forgo his senior year and entered the NBA draft. Green spent the next four summers taking classes at Georgetown and graduated in 2012 with a degree in English and a minor in theology.

Jonas Jerebko on InstagramRobert Aaron Williams (May 5, 1961 – March 10, 2014), was an American former professional basketball player who was selected by the Denver Nuggets in the first round (19th overall) of the 1982 NBA draft.
A 6-foot-2 point guard from the University of Houston, Williams played in two National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons for the Nuggets.  When Williams reported to Denver's training camp as a rookie, he was badly out of shape, prompting Nuggets coach Doug Moe to describe Williams as "a fat little hog".Williams' collegiate career included a trip to the 1982 NCAA Final Four, where his Houston Cougars, better known as Phi Slama Jama, fell to the North Carolina Tar Heels in the National Semifinals.
A former star at Milby High School in Houston, Williams was an electrifying player for the University of Houston, averaging 16 points per game as a freshman, 25 per game as a sophomore, and 21 points per game for the 1982 Final Four team.  Williams was an All American and perennial All Southwest Conference performer.  His collegiate teammates included Hakeem Olajuwon, Clyde Drexler, Michael Young, Benny Anders and Larry Micheaux among others.
In his NBA career, Williams played in 153 games and scored a total of 1,319 points.  Following his brief NBA career, he played professionally in the Continental Basketball Association, Italy, Australia, Spain, and the Philippines.
In 1986, Williams strutted his wares as an import for Tanduay Rhum in the Philippine Basketball Association's (PBA) Reinforced Conference that year, where teams were allowed to suit up two imports no taller than 6 ft 3 in.  Along with partner Andre McKoy and local superstars Ramon Fernandez, Freddie Hubalde and Willie Generalao, among others, the flamboyant and sweet-shooting Williams led Tanduay to its first championship in franchise history. 
In a May 2005 Houston Chronicle story, Williams admitted using drugs while he played. He suffered a stroke in January 1998 that left him blind in his left eye and partially paralyzed along the left side of his body.
On March 10, 2014, Rob Williams died of congestive heart failure at age 52.Since 2005, Williams and his wife had operated a care facility for mentally-challenged adults in Katy, Texas.

Rob Williams' death
Rob Williams at Find a GraveAcie Boyd Earl (born June 23, 1970) is an American former professional basketball player, who appeared in four National Basketball Association (NBA) seasons, as a 6'10" 240 lb (110 kg) center.


== High school/college ==
Born in Peoria, Illinois, Earl was a star basketball player from Moline High School playing varsity-level basketball for three seasons. He led the Maroons to a 23-4 record in 1988, along with future NFL All-Pro Brad Hopkins. Earl is currently the seventh leading all-time scorer in Moline basketball history.
Earl played college basketball at the University of Iowa, being a key recruit for Tom Davis' Hawkeyes. He appeared in 22 games in his first-year season, with an average of 6 points in 16 minutes, but still managed 50 blocked shots in limited playing time.
In his second season, Earl became a key force in the Big Ten Conference, averaging 16.3 points and 6.7 rebounds per game, with 106 total blocked shots. Iowa made it to the 1991 NCAA Tournament where they were defeated by eventual champions Duke Blue Devils in the second round.
In his junior year, Earl slightly improved his numbers (managing to block an average of four shots a game), while the college made it to the 1992 NCAA Tournament, only to lose, again in the second round and against Duke (also the eventual winners), 75-62, with Earl blocking 8 shot attempts, one shy of the all-time tournament record held by David Robinson.
With Earl still putting up strong numbers in 1992-93, Iowa again lost in the second round of the NCAA Tournament, now to Wake Forest.
Earl graduated as the 1992 Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, and upon graduation held the Iowa career record with 358 blocked shots, and was second in total points scored with 1779 (after Roy Marble). He received his undergraduate degree in the fall of 1992 with a degree in Leisure studies.


== Professional career ==
Earl was selected in the first round of the 1993 NBA draft by the Boston Celtics with the 19th pick, in a year which included Chris Webber, Jamal Mashburn and Anfernee Hardaway. He played 74 games in his rookie season, averaging 5.5 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.
His statistics dropped in his second year, as he played in only 30 games, and was subsequently selected by the Toronto Raptors in the 1995 NBA expansion draft after the Celtics left him unprotected. With the Raptors, he posted his best statistical season, scoring 7.5 points per game, adding 3.1 rebounds. On April 12, 1996, against the team that drafted him - the Celtics - Earl posted a double-double, with 40 points and 12 rebounds in a 136-108 loss. Midway through 1996-97, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, appearing in nine games in his final NBA season.
Subsequently, Earl took his game overseas, first appearing for Paris Basket Racing (France), also playing 21 games in Australia for the National Basketball League's Sydney Kings in 1998-99. In 1998, he also played with the CBA's LaCrosse Bobcats.
He then represented Türk Telekom Ankara and Darussafaka Istanbul Spor Kulubu (Turkey), Unics Kazan and Saratov Autodor (Russia), Śląsk Wrocław (Poland), Traiskirchen Arkadia Lions (Austria) and KK Budućnost Podgorica (Montenegro), retiring in 2004. He also had a small stint for KB Peja, in Kosovo, helping the team become state champions.
Moving into coaching, Earl managed, during 2005, the Tijuana Dragons of the American Basketball Association (ABA) team based in Tijuana, Mexico.

Legabasket.it ProfileAdam John Morrison (born July 19, 1984) is an American retired professional basketball player. Morrison played for three years at Gonzaga University and was considered to be one of the top college basketball players in 2005–06. He was a finalist for the Naismith and the Wooden Award. He was named Co-Player of the Year with Duke's J. J. Redick by the United States Basketball Writers Association and won the 2006 Chevrolet Player of the Year award. He played for the NBA teams Charlotte Bobcats from 2006 to 2009 and L.A. Lakers in 2009-2010.


== Early life ==
Morrison's father, John, worked as a basketball coach, and the family moved with his coaching career: Casper College in Northwest Casper, Wyoming, Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Dawson Community College in Glendive, Montana. When Morrison was in the fourth grade, his father left coaching, and the family moved to Spokane, Washington. Adam became the Gonzaga men's team's ball boy.When he was in the eighth grade, he lost 30 pounds (14 kg), and while attending a basketball camp at Gonzaga during this time, he felt sick, later saying about his experience at the camp, "I think I made one shot the whole three days. I was sicker than a dog. I didn't want to play. I couldn't do anything." Shortly after this, Morrison was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. He took his diagnosis surprisingly well; the second time a nurse came to administer insulin, he stopped her, telling her, "Since I'm going to be doing this the rest of my life, you might as well show me how to do it." However, his illness did not keep him from becoming a star at Mead Senior High School in Spokane. In his senior year he broke single-season and career scoring records in his high school conference, and led Mead to the finals of the state tournament. Despite playing in the final game with hypoglycemia so severe that he nearly suffered a seizure, he scored 37 points in a losing effort. It was Mead's only loss that season. Morrison was not heavily recruited out of high school. Dave Telep of scout.com admitted, "In one of the biggest misses of my career, we left him off the Top 100 list. We ranked him the No. 26 small forward. The goal is to never make a mistake of that magnitude again".


== College career ==
Morrison arrived at Gonzaga University to play for the Gonzaga Bulldogs in 2003. In his freshman year he averaged 11.4 points per game (ppg), with a season-high 22 points against St. Mary's. Gonzaga won the West Coast Conference (WCC) regular-season title. Morrison was named to the WCC All-Freshman Team.In his sophomore year Morrison averaged 19.0 ppg. He scored a season-high 28 points at home against San Francisco, including the winning shot with 0.6 seconds to play in the game. Gonzaga again won the WCC regular-season title. Morrison made the All-WCC First Team and was selected to the Basketball Times All-West Coast Team as well as being named an honorable mention Associated Press All-American.In his junior year during Gonzaga's first two games of the 2005–06 season at the Maui Invitational, Morrison played well against two of the sport's top programs. In the first round, Morrison scored 25 points in a Gonzaga win over Maryland. He followed up this performance with 43 points in a triple-overtime win over Michigan State in the semifinals. He matched that output against in-state rival Washington on December 4, 2005, in a losing effort. However, Morrison and the Zags bounced back a week later, defeating Oklahoma State after he banked in a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds left to give Gonzaga a two-point lead and eventually the win.
In the regular season, he had 13 games of 30-plus points, with five of them over 40. At 28.1 points per game, he was the nation's leading scorer in 2005–2006. His scoring totals against teams in the "major" conferences were no less impressive; he averaged 28.5 points in 11 such games. On February 18, Morrison recorded a career high 44 points (including 37 in the second half alone) against the Loyola Marymount Lions in a winning effort.
Morrison led the Zags with 24 points in a 2006 NCAA Tournament Sweet Sixteen match against UCLA, which the Zags lost in the final seconds after UCLA had eliminated a 17-point deficit coming out of the first half. With seconds left, the lead having slipped away after Morrison's teammates committed 3 turnovers in less than 5 seconds, Morrison broke down in tears and collapsed to the court. He was eventually helped to his feet by UCLA player Arron Afflalo. He has been both criticized and praised for this unbridled show of emotion. He later shared the national player of the year award with friendly rival J. J. Redick of Duke. The game against UCLA turned out to be Morrison's final collegiate game, as he later decided to turn pro, foregoing his senior year of college.


== Professional career ==


=== Charlotte Bobcats (2006–2009) ===
Morrison was selected 3rd overall pick in the 2006 NBA draft by the Charlotte Bobcats, behind Andrea Bargnani (Toronto Raptors) and LaMarcus Aldridge (Chicago Bulls). On July 6, 2006, the Bobcats signed Morrison to a two-year contract. On November 1, 2006, in his NBA debut against the Indiana Pacers he scored 14 points. He was the first player drafted by Manager of Basketball Operations Michael Jordan in his tenure with the Bobcats. He scored his career high on December 30, 2006, with 30 points in a win against the Indiana Pacers. However, Morrison lost his starting spot midway through his rookie season, in part because of his defense and in part because he shot only 37% for the year.On October 21, 2007, the Charlotte Bobcats announced that Morrison had sustained a severe injury to his left knee in a pre-season exhibition game against the L.A. Lakers while defending Luke Walton, bending his knee laterally and falling to the ground in pain. An MRI scan performed after the game indicated a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). On November 10 Morrison underwent surgery to repair the damage. The injury was confirmed to be a torn ACL, requiring several months of physical therapy after the knee had healed, meaning he missed the whole 2007–08 NBA season.


=== Los Angeles Lakers (2009–2010) ===
On February 7, 2009, Morrison and Shannon Brown were traded to the Los Angeles Lakers for Vladimir Radmanović. Morrison won NBA championships with the Lakers in 2009 and 2010, but saw very limited playing time. He was released following the 2009–10 season.


=== European career and attempts to play in the NBA (2010–2012) ===
Morrison signed with the Washington Wizards in 2010, but was waived at the end of training camp before playing a regular season game.In September 2011, Morrison signed with KK Crvena zvezda. He was released from his contract in November 2011 to pursue other opportunities. During his 8-game stay in Belgrade (he missed one away game due to a minor injury), Morrison averaged 15.5 points, 3.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists in 29 minutes a game, becoming his team's top scorer and the second overall top performer during the 2011–12 Adriatic League season.In January 2012, Morrison signed with Beşiktaş Milangaz for the rest of the 2011–12 season. However, he left the team in April 2012 due to a lack of playing time.After being absent from the NBA since being waived by the Wizards, Morrison played in the 2012 NBA Summer League for the Brooklyn Nets and averaged 5.2 points and 19.2 minutes in five games with the team. He then joined the Los Angeles Clippers' Summer League team, averaging 20.0 points, 5.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists on 55% FG (38–69), 61% 3-PT (13–21) and 78% FT (11–14) in 5 games.On September 21, 2012, Morrison signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. He was waived on October 27, 2012.


== National team career ==
Morrison made four appearances for various junior U.S. national teams. Morrison was selected to train with the senior men's team in preparation for the 2006 FIBA World Championship but was cut prior to the tournament.


== Coaching career ==
In July 2013, Gonzaga basketball coach Mark Few announced that Morrison would become a student assistant with the basketball team. Morrison had returned to Gonzaga to take classes. After completing his undergraduate degree at Gonzaga in 2014, majoring in sports management, Morrison became an assistant video coordinator for the Bulldogs for the 2014–15 season, but was weighing options for his career after the season would come to an end.


== Personal life ==
Morrison lives near Spokane, Washington, with his girlfriend, two daughters, and a son. He is not religious and does not believe in marriage.


=== Diabetes ===
Morrison was diagnosed with 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent diabetes) at age 13. He was playing in an eighth-grade basketball game, and as the game went into overtime, he began having seizure-like symptoms, which prompted his father to take him to the hospital where the diagnosis was made. Morrison, who managed his diabetes to the point of eating exactly the same meals at the same time on game days, is considered a role model for children with the disease and their families. During his freshman year at Gonzaga, Morrison and his life with diabetes were a subject of a four-page article in Sports Illustrated. On the first day that the issue appeared in retail outlets, more than fifty parents of children with diabetes contacted the Gonzaga athletics department asking if Morrison could speak to their children. Off the court, Morrison regulates his blood sugar with an insulin pump attached to his abdomen.

Louisville Cardinals bioAl Ricardo Jefferson (born January 4, 1985) is an American former professional basketball player. He played high school basketball for Prentiss High School in Mississippi before skipping college to enter the 2004 NBA draft, where he was drafted 15th overall by the Boston Celtics. He has previously played for the Celtics, Minnesota Timberwolves, Utah Jazz, Charlotte Hornets and Indiana Pacers.


== High school career ==
Born in Monticello, Mississippi, Jefferson attended Prentiss High School in the small nearby town of Prentiss from 2000 to 2004. After starting for his varsity team as a freshman at Prentiss, he became one of the elite players in the country as a junior, drawing the attention of both college coaches around the country, and the scouts of the NBA. In his senior year for the Bulldogs, he averaged an astounding 42.6 points, 18 rebounds and seven blocks per game as his Bulldogs team went on to lose in the Mississippi state class 3A semi-finals to Byhalia High School 88–73, in which Jefferson finished with 56 points.Considered a five-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jefferson was listed as the No. 1 center and the No. 4 player in the nation in 2004. He had originally committed to Arkansas, but opted instead to make the jump to the NBA straight out of high school.


== Professional career ==


=== Boston Celtics (2004–2007) ===
Jefferson was drafted with the 15th overall pick by the Boston Celtics in the 2004 NBA draft, becoming the first high school player to be drafted by the Celtics (Kendrick Perkins was drafted by the Grizzlies, then traded to Boston on draft day in the 2003 NBA draft). He played primarily as a power forward and averaged 6.7 points and 4.4 rebounds in 14.8 minutes per game during his rookie season.
Jefferson's 2005–06 season was widely considered a disappointment, mostly due to a series of ankle injuries and a torn meniscus in his right knee which limited him to playing in 59 games. He averaged 7.9 points and 5.1 rebounds in 18.0 minutes per game during his sophomore season.
In the off-season prior to the 2006–07 season, Jefferson hired a personal chef and lost about 30 pounds. After experiencing lingering pain after participating in the Las Vegas Summer League, a CAT scan revealed bone spurs. On August 2, 2006, he underwent ankle surgery to remove the bone spurs. On November 8, 2006, prior to the fourth game of the season, Jefferson had appendectomy surgery at New England Baptist Hospital and subsequently missed seven games as he returned to the lineup on November 22, 2006.


==== 2006–07 season ====
While already playing increased minutes (9.3 points and 7.0 rebounds in 22.0 minutes per game over nine games as a reserve), Jefferson's role expanded due to an injury to starting center Kendrick Perkins. With backup centers Michael Olowokandi and Theo Ratliff already on the injured list, Celtics' coach Doc Rivers started Jefferson at center on December 6, 2006 against the Memphis Grizzlies. Over the next seven games, Jefferson averaged 16.3 points and 11.1 rebounds in 33.7 minutes per game. In what some considered a breakout performance against the New Jersey Nets on December 9, 2006, he scored a career-high 29 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, which tied a career high (set on May 5, 2005 in a playoff game against the Indiana Pacers). It was the second time he had scored more than 20 points in a game. The previous occasion was on December 10, 2005 against the Dallas Mavericks where he scored 21 points. His third and fourth 20-point game came six and seven days after the second, on December 15 and December 16, when he scored 28 against the Denver Nuggets and 22 against the Charlotte Bobcats. These efforts punctuated a five-game win streak by the Boston Celtics.
On March 3, 2007, Jefferson scored a career-high 32 points to go along with 18 rebounds against the New Jersey Nets, against whom he had previously set his career high in points against earlier in the season. On March 5, Jefferson was named the NBA's Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week starting February 26 through March 4.


=== Minnesota Timberwolves (2007–2010) ===


==== 2007–08 season ====
On July 31, 2007, Jefferson was traded, along with Gerald Green, Ryan Gomes, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair and draft picks, to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Kevin Garnett. After landing in Minnesota, Jefferson quickly signed a large contract extension before the season. At $65 million over five years, it was satisfactory but he could have gotten a max deal. Instead he chose not to pursue one, due to "having not really proved" himself.In his first season with the Timberwolves, Jefferson was the team's scoring leader. Playing in all 82 games, he ranked 20th in the NBA in points per game (11th in total points), averaging 21.0 points per game while shooting .500 from the field.  Jefferson also defined himself as one of the premier big men in the NBA by being only one of four players to average 20 points and 10 rebounds (the others being Dwight Howard, Carlos Boozer and Antawn Jamison). Jefferson ranked 5th in the NBA in rebounding, averaging 11.1 (4th in total rebounds) and 2nd in offensive rebounds per game (3.8), only behind Tyson Chandler (4.1).  Jefferson is ranked 12th in the NBA efficiency and is 3rd in the NBA in double-doubles.
In January 2008, Jefferson won Western Conference Player of the Week honors after averaging 33.3 points and 15.3 rebounds and leading the Timberwolves to a 3–1 record from January 21 to 27.Jefferson scored a career-high 40 points against the New Jersey Nets on January 27, 2008 and repeated such a performance against the Charlotte Bobcats on April 8, 2008.

Jefferson was having a career best year, averaging 23.1 points, 11.0 rebounds and 1.7 blocks per game in the first 50 games of the season, until suffering a serious right knee injury after landing awkwardly on one leg in a game at New Orleans.  Jefferson claimed that he felt a pop in his knee and the injury resulted in a complete tear to the ACL which required reconstructive surgery that ended his season.  At the time the Wolves were 17–33 and showing signs of improvement, but with Jefferson out, they went 7–25 over their remaining games, and were a lottery team once again.


==== 2009–10 season ====
On January 13, 2010, Jefferson set a single-game franchise record with 26 rebounds in a triple overtime loss to the Houston Rockets. The record was later surpassed by Kevin Love in November 2010.Coming off knee surgery, Jefferson had a solid season in 2009–10 as he played 76 games while averaging 17.1 points, 9.3 rebounds and a career-high 1.8 assists in 32.4 minutes per game.


=== Utah Jazz (2010–2013) ===


==== 2010–11 season ====
On July 13, 2010, Jefferson was traded to the Utah Jazz for two future first round picks and center Kosta Koufos. With the chance to play alongside All-Star point guard Deron Williams, Jefferson couldn't be happier, but his first season in Utah brought numerous ups and downs. The in-season departures of Williams and coach Jerry Sloan were a shock to the system, but Jefferson didn't back away from the challenges. Instead, he saw the need for a new leader and stepped up to become part of the foundation for a young team to build on.In what was an injury-riddled season for the Jazz, Jefferson started in all 82 games during the regular season and regained some of his explosiveness in 2011, showing he was fully recovered from the devastating knee injury he suffered in 2009. His return to form contributed 37 double-doubles during the season and 794 total rebounds – the second highest total of his career. He finished the 2010–11 season with averages of 18.6 points and 9.7 rebounds per game.


==== 2011–12 season ====
In the lockout shortened 2011–12 season, Jefferson furthered his improvement, transitioning into his role as team leader while continuing to put up the impressive numbers that have become common for him. He showed energy and tenacity all season as well as an improved defensive game, and heading into the All-Star break, many were calling for him to be selected to his first All-Star team, including Brian T. Smith of The Salt Lake Tribune who noted, "If the Jazz keep winning during January and Jefferson keeps producing, the eight-year veteran could finally be in the running for an All-Star spot."Despite not receiving an All-Star selection, Jefferson ended the season tied for seventh in the league with 31 double doubles and led his team back to the playoffs. Behind Jefferson's strong season, the young Jazz finished 36-30 and secured the eighth seed in the West where they faced the San Antonio Spurs in the first round. While Jefferson did his best to contain Spurs' superstar Tim Duncan, Utah simply couldn't measure up against San Antonio. The Spurs swept the Jazz in four games and would eventually go on to reach the conference finals.


==== 2012–13 season ====
Throughout the 2012–13 season, Jefferson was the driving force for the Jazz, leading the team again in scoring and rebounding and finishing in the top ten in the league in double doubles yet again with 37 compiled throughout the course of the season. He posted a career-high 40 points late in the season against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was poised to be the catalyst for the Jazz to make a return trip to the playoffs. Unfortunately, the Jazz narrowly missed out on returning to the playoffs, falling just two games shy of the No. 8 seed with a 43–39 record. Despite the season ending early, Jefferson again established himself as a force down low and figured to be one of the most valued free agents heading into the offseason.


=== Charlotte Bobcats / Hornets (2013–2016) ===


==== 2013–14 season ====

On July 10, 2013, Jefferson signed a three-year, $40.5 million contract with the Charlotte Bobcats. However, despite the big contract with a new team, Jefferson's arrival was delayed by a right ankle sprain that caused him to miss the entire preseason and nine of the team's first 12 games. Though he was slowed by the ankle injury, upon his return, Jefferson showed glimpses of promise while working himself back into rhythm as by the time January rolled around, he was finally healthy and ready to dominate. On January 31, 2014, Jefferson tied a career high with 40 points in a win against the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued his high level of play en route to winning the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for his performance in March 2014. He averaged 24.7 points and 10.6 rebounds while shooting 55% from the floor during the month of March, and went on to win the Eastern Conference Player of the Month for April 2014 as well.

On April 20, 2014, Jefferson suffered a plantar fasciitis injury during Game 1 of the Bobcats' first round playoff series against the Miami Heat and later missed Game 4 because of the injury. On June 4, 2014, Jefferson was named to the 2014 All-NBA third team.


==== 2014–15 season ====
After kicking back into form in 2013–14 with his best averages since 2008–09, Jefferson continued to thrive with the young, newly named Charlotte Hornets in 2014–15. On November 7, 2014, Jefferson scored a season-high 34 points in the Hornets' 122–119 double overtime win over the Atlanta Hawks to move to a record of 3–3. Despite the great win and a promising start to the season, the Hornets went on to lose the next 12 out of 13 games, with a 10-game losing streak expanding from November 15 to December 3. The team finally broke the streak on December 5 against the New York Knicks, as Jefferson recorded 16 points and 13 rebounds in the 103–102 win.During the fourth quarter of the Hornets' 104–86 win over the Utah Jazz on December 20, Jefferson had nearly registered his third straight game with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds but left the game with six minutes remaining with a mild groin strain and did not return. In 27 minutes of action, he recorded 19 points and 10 rebounds. Despite the injury scare, Jefferson played the following game against the Denver Nuggets on December 22, recording 22 points and 7 rebounds to help the Hornets win their third straight game. His recurring groin injury flared up again on December 29 against the Milwaukee Bucks as he left the game during the fourth quarter and did not return after managing just 6 points and 8 rebounds. The Hornets went on to lose the game in overtime. He was subsequently ruled out for four weeks the following day after he was diagnosed with a strained adductor muscle in his left groin. After missing nine games with the injury, Jefferson returned on January 19, recording 8 points and 5 rebounds in a Hornets win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Coming off the bench, it marked the first time since December 4, 2006 – a span of 544 games – that Jefferson didn't start in a game in which he played. He came off the bench for a further three games before reclaiming his starting spot on January 28 against San Antonio and subsequently recorded 17 points and 16 rebounds in a loss to the Spurs.On March 11, in a loss to the Sacramento Kings, Jefferson left the game late in the third quarter due to a strained right calf after managing 9 points and 6 rebounds in 24 minutes of action. He returned after sitting out one game to score 10 points in a blowout loss to the Utah Jazz. On March 22, he recorded his 20th double-double of the season with 18 points and a team-high 11 rebounds in a 109–98 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.On June 15, 2015, Jefferson exercised his player option with the Hornets for the 2015–16 season.

He missed 11 games between December 2 and December 23 due to injury and suspension, returning to action on December 26 against the Memphis Grizzlies, coming off the bench for the first time since January 24, 2015. He finished with two points on 1-of-8 shooting and four rebounds in 17 minutes, and fouled out with 8:10 remaining in the fourth quarter.

Al Jefferson at nba.comTyler Paul Zeller (born January 17, 1990) is an American professional basketball player. He is the nephew of former NBA player Al Eberhard, and the brother of fellow NBA players Cody Zeller and Luke Zeller.


== High school career ==
Born in Visalia, California, Tyler Zeller grew up in Washington, Indiana, attending Washington High School. In his four years at Washington High, his team won four sectional titles, as well as state Class 3A championships in his freshman and senior years (2005 and 2008). In his senior year, he averaged 33.1 points and 11.0 rebounds per game, and also shot 69% from the field and 82% from the free throw line. In his final high school game, the '08 Class 3A final against Fort Wayne Harding, he scored 47 points, which broke a record for scoring by a player in an Indiana boys' state championship game that had stood since 1970. He was not only a basketball superstar, but also played on Washington High's tennis team for three years, and finished his high school career with a 3.99 grade point average on a 4.0 scale, good for third in his graduating class. After the 2008 season, he was named "Mr. Basketball" in Indiana, the state's highest honor for high school players. He received the title three years after his brother Luke and three years before his brother Cody were honored with the same award.  He was also named a McDonald's All-American, as well as a first-team Parade All-American.
During the early stages of the signing period in November 2007, Zeller signed a letter of intent to play at North Carolina. When the university announced his signing, Tar Heels head coach Roy Williams said about Zeller, "I think he is the finest running big man in the country and he has a tremendous shooting touch to go with that ability to run the floor." Zeller notably exhibited that shooting touch at a high school all-star game during the 2008 Kentucky Derby Festival, at which he won the event's three-point shooting contest.Considered a four-star recruit by Rivals.com, Zeller was listed as the No. 7 center and the No. 33 player in the nation in 2008.


== College career ==
Zeller started the first two games of the 2008–09 season in place of the previous season's consensus national Player of the Year, Tyler Hansbrough, who was sidelined with a stress reaction in his right shin. In his first game, he scored 18 points in Carolina's season-opening win over Penn.The Tar Heels' next game, on November 18, was against another equally storied team, Kentucky. The Heels scored a surprisingly easy 77–58 win over the Wildcats, but suffered another injury blow, this time involving Zeller. With 1:26 left in the game, Zeller went for a breakaway dunk off a turnover, but was fouled by Kentucky's Ramon Harris before he could score. Zeller fell to the floor awkwardly, got up, and was taken to the locker room holding his left wrist.X-rays showed that Zeller had broken both of the major bones in his lower left arm (the radius and ulna). The day after the injury, he had surgery at UNC Hospitals to repair the broken bones.  In early January 2009, Zeller's cast was removed.
Zeller made his return during his freshman season on February 18, 2009, in the Tar Heels' home game against North Carolina State, playing 8 minutes and scoring 2 points.
As a sophomore, Zeller averaged 9.3 points per game on 52.1% shooting and 4.6 rebounds per game in limited action off the bench.Zeller averaged 15.7 points per game during his junior year. He shot 54.7% and averaged 7.2 rebounds per game. He had a more active role, playing an average of 28.1 minutes per game, significantly more than the 17.4 minutes per game during his sophomore campaign.Zeller averaged 16.5 points per game on 55.3% shooting during his senior season. He also played an average of 28.2 minutes per game.Zeller was voted to the All-ACC First Team his senior year and was named the ACC Player of the Year.  Zeller was also named a second team all American by the Sporting News and the USBWA as a senior.

As a senior, he averaged 28 points per game and earned Indiana's "Mr. Basketball" award as he led his team to the state runner-up spot. He was twice named first-team All-Indiana and was named MVP of both Indiana vs. Kentucky all-star games as a senior.

He attended Purdue for three days, but realizing he would be required to enroll in ROTC for two years and would not be able to have a car on campus as a freshman, he returned home and then decided to attend his other choice, Cincinnati, due largely to the national success gained by the Bearcats during the recent Oscar Robertson era.As a sophomore under coach Ed Jucker, Bonham averaged 14.3 points per game, led the Bearcats with a .760 free throw percentage and was named All-Missouri Valley Conference (MVC). The Bearcats won the MVC title and posted a 29-2 overall record.

== Early life ==
Born to James Thomas and Tina Baldtrip, Isaiah Thomas was named after former Detroit Pistons Hall of Fame guard Isiah Thomas. A lifelong Lakers fan, James made a bet with a friend that his beloved team would defeat the Pistons in the 1989 Finals or he would name his son after decorated Lakers nemesis Isiah Thomas. The Pistons won in a four-game sweep, but James had already warmed to the name well before then. His mother consented to it on condition that it took the Biblical spelling. He was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. As a child, he had the nicknames "Bighead" (or Head) from his father and "Zeke" from his mother, after Isiah Thomas's nickname.
